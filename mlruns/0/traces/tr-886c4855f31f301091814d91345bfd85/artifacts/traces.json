DO NOT EDIT. ======================================================\\\\n\\\\nthis file is generated from src/style.less\\\\n\\\\nOpinionThe Privacy Project Google’s 4,000-Word Privacy Policy Is a Secret History of the Internet By Charlie Warzel and Ash Ngu Illustrated by Rose Wong\\\\n\\\\nThe late 1990s was a simpler time for Google. The nascent company was merely a search engine, and Gmail, Android and YouTube were but glimmers in the startup’s eye. Google’s first privacy policy reflected that simplicity. It was short and earnest, a quaint artifact of a different time in Silicon Valley, when Google offered 600 words to explain how it was collecting and using personal information.\\\\n\\\\nThat version of the internet (and Google) is gone. Over the past 20 years, that same privacy policy has been rewritten into a sprawling 4,000-word explanation of the company’s data practices.\\\\n\\\\nThis evolution, across two decades and 30 versions, is the story of the internet’s transformation through the eyes of one of its most crucial entities. The web is now terribly complex, and Google has a privacy policy to match.\\\\n\\\\nGoogle’s Privacy Policy Over Time 1999 Google is sensitive to the privacy concerns of its users. The Internet allows individuals to explore and communicate with unprecedented ease, but it also allows websites to collect and distribute personal information with equal ease. We at Google know that many users are, understandably, concerned about such practices, and we wish to make clear our policy for collecting and using personal information. Google’s Policy Google’s policy on our wholly controlled and operated Internet sites is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. Google does not willfully disclose individually identifiable information about its customers to any third party without first receiving that customer’s permission. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it. Google may share information about users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we only talk about our users in aggregate, not as individuals. For example, we may disclose how frequently the average Google user visits Google, or which other query words are most often used with the query word “Microsoft.” From time to time, there may be situations where Google asks you for personal information. When we intend to use your personal information, we tell you up front. This way you can decide whether you want to give us the information or not. In case you change your mind or some personal information changes, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us. Google and Cookies Upon your first visit to Google, Google sends a “cookie” to your computer. A cookie is a file that identifies you as a unique user. It can also store personal preferences and user data. A cookie can tell us, “This is the same individual who visited Google two days ago” but it cannot tell us, “This person is Joe Smith” or even, “This person lives in the United States.” Google uses cookies to track user trends and patterns, in order to better understand our user base and to improve the quality of our service. Google may also choose to use cookies to store user preferences. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of Google may not function properly if you refuse cookies. Links to Other Sites The page that comes up after “clicking” on a result URL is likely to be outside the Google site and beyond our control. Other links, such as for the Google-friends mailing list archive, are also on sites not controlled by Google. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Google may choose to exhibit its search results in the form of a “URL redirecter.” When a URL redirecter is used, whenever you “click” on a URL from a search result, information about the “click” is sent to Google, which then sends you to the site you clicked on. Google uses this URL information to understand and improve the quality of Google’s search technology. For instance, Google uses this information to determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results. Google’s policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Google’s control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. We reserve the right at our discretion to make changes to this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. 2009 At Google we recognize that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by Google Inc. or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies except DoubleClick (DoubleClick Privacy Policy) and Postini (Postini Privacy Policy); collectively, Google’s “services.” In addition, where more detailed information is needed to explain our privacy practices, we post supplementary privacy notices to describe how particular services process personal information. These notices can be found in the Google Privacy Center. Google adheres to the US Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement, and is registered with the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor Program. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us through our website or write to us at Privacy Matters c/o Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, California, 94043 USA Information we collect and how we use it We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information to us, such as Google Search. In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information: Information you provide – When you sign up for a Google Account or other Google service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password). For certain services, such as our advertising programs, we also request credit card or other payment account information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers. We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other Google services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information. Cookies – When you visit Google, we send one or more cookies – a small file containing a string of characters – to your computer or other device that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, improving search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends, such as how people search. Google also uses cookies in its advertising services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. We may set one or more cookies in your browser when you visit a website, including Google sites that use our advertising cookies, and view or click on an ad supported by Google’s advertising services. Log information – When you access Google services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. User communications – When you send email or other communications to Google, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. Affiliated Google Services on other sites – We offer some of our services on or through other web sites. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to Google in order to deliver the service. We process such information under this Privacy Policy. The affiliated sites through which our services are offered may have different privacy practices and we encourage you to read their privacy policies. Gadgets – Google may make available third party applications through its services. The information collected by Google when you enable a gadget or other application is processed under this Privacy Policy. Information collected by the application or gadget provider is governed by their privacy policies. Location data – Google offers location-enabled services, such as Google Maps for mobile. If you use those services, Google may receive information about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate a location (such as a cell ID). Links – Google may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality of our search technology, customized content and advertising. Read more information about links and redirected URLs. Other sites – This Privacy Policy applies to Google services only. We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as search results, sites that include Google applications, products or services, or links from within our various services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Google only processes personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and/or the supplementary privacy notices for specific services. In addition to the above, such purposes include: Providing our services, including the display of customized content and advertising; Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services; Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; Protecting the rights or property of Google or our users; and Developing new services. You can find more information about how we process personal information by referring to the supplementary privacy notices for particular services. Google processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country. We may process personal information to provide our own services. In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising partners. Choices for personal information When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service privacy notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the supplementary service privacy notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Google features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. Google uses the DoubleClick advertising cookie on AdSense partner sites and certain Google services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. You can view, edit, and manage your ads preferences associated with this cookie by accessing the Ads Preferences Manager. In addition, you may choose to opt out of the DoubleClick cookie at any time by using DoubleClick’s opt-out cookie. You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case Google may not be able to provide those services to you. Information sharing Google only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Google in the following limited circumstances: We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information. We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, its users or the public as required or permitted by law. If Google becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually. Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data. Information security We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. Data integrity Google processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services or as otherwise permitted under this Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary. Accessing and updating personal information When you use Google services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users’ personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services. Enforcement Google regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or Google’s treatment of personal information by contacting us through this web site or by writing to us at Privacy Matters c/o Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, California, 94043 USA When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is Google’s policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Google and an individual. Changes to this Privacy Policy Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). Each version of this Privacy Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and we will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.

INFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls. When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions. When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information. Things you create or provide to us When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services. We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos. Information we collect as you use our services Your apps, browsers & devices We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low. The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request. We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and which apps you've installed. Your activity We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include: Terms you search for Videos you watch Views and interactions with content and ads Voice and audio information when you use audio features Purchase activity People with whom you communicate or share content Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services Chrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account If you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types of calls. You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account. Go to Google Account Your location information We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions for your weekend getaway or showtimes for movies playing near you. Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by: GPS IP address Sensor data from your device Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Google’s Policy Google’s policy on our wholly controlled and operated Internet sites is to respect and protect the privacy of our users.

These include:\\\\n\\\\n- GPS and other sensor data from your device\\\\n\\\\n- IP address\\\\n\\\\n- Activity on Google services, such as from your searches or places you label like home or work\\\\n\\\\n- Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices\\\\n\\\\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Timeline if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\\\\n\\\\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\\\\n\\\\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\\\\n\\\\n# Why Google collects data\\\\n\\\\n## We use data to build better services\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\\\\n\\\\n### Provide our services\\\\n\\\\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\\\\n\\\\n### Maintain & improve our services\\\\n\\\\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\\\\n\\\\n### Develop new services\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\\\\n\\\\n### Provide personalized services, including content and ads\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\\\\n\\\\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\\\\n\\\\nGo to My Ad Center\\\\n\\\\n### Measure performance\\\\n\\\\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\\\\n\\\\n### Communicate with you\\\\n\\\\n### Protect Google, our users, and the public\\\\n\\\\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\\\\n\\\\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\\\\n\\\\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.\\\\n\\\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\\\\n\\\\n# Your privacy controls\\\\n\\\\n## You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\\\\n\\\\nGo to Privacy Checkup\\\\n\\\\n## Managing, reviewing, and updating your information\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.\\\\n\\\\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:\\\\n\\\\n### Privacy controls\\\\n\\\\n### Activity Controls\\\\n\\\\nDecide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Activity Controls\\\\n\\\\n### Ad settings\\\\n\\\\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. You can modify your interests, choose whether your personal information is used to make ads more relevant to you, and turn on or off certain advertising services.\\\\n\\\\n### About you\\\\n\\\\nManage personal info in your Google Account and control who can see it across Google services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to About You\\\\n\\\\n### Shared endorsements\\\\n\\\\nChoose whether your name and photo appear next to your activity, like reviews and recommendations, that appear in ads.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Shared Endorsements\\\\n\\\\n### Sites and apps that use Google services\\\\n\\\\nManage information that websites and apps using Google services, like Google Analytics, may share with Google when you visit or interact with their services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services\\\\n\\\\n### Ways to review & update your information\\\\n\\\\n### My Activity\\\\n\\\\nMy Activity allows you to review and control data that’s saved to your Google Account when you’re signed in and using Google services, like searches you’ve done or your visits to Google Play. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.\\\\n\\\\nGo to My Activity\\\\n\\\\n### Google Dashboard\\\\n\\\\nGoogle Dashboard allows you to manage information associated with specific products.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Dashboard\\\\n\\\\n### Your personal information\\\\n\\\\nManage your contact information, such as your name, email, and phone number.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Personal Info\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed out, you can manage information associated with your browser or device, including:\\\\n\\\\n- Signed-out search personalization: Choose whether your search activity is used to offer you more relevant results and recommendations.\\\\n\\\\n- YouTube settings: Pause and delete your YouTube Search History and your YouTube Watch History.\\\\n\\\\n- Ad Settings: Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.\\\\n\\\\n## Exporting, removing & deleting your information\\\\n\\\\nYou can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.\\\\n\\\\nExport your data\\\\n\\\\nTo delete your information, you can:\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your content from specific Google services\\\\n\\\\n- Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\\\\n\\\\n- Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your entire Google Account\\\\n\\\\nDelete your information\\\\n\\\\nInactive Account Manager allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account.\\\\n\\\\nAnd finally, you can also request to remove content from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.\\\\n\\\\nThere are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:\\\\n\\\\n- Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a cookie in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.\\\\n\\\\n- Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\\\\n\\\\n# Sharing your information\\\\n\\\\n## When you share your information\\\\n\\\\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.\\\\n\\\\n## When Google shares your information\\\\n\\\\nWe do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:\\\\n\\\\n### With your consent\\\\n\\\\nWe’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.\\\\n\\\\n### With domain administrators\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:\\\\n\\\\n- Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email\\\\n\\\\n- View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install\\\\n\\\\n- Change your account password\\\\n\\\\n- Suspend or terminate your account access\\\\n\\\\n- Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request\\\\n\\\\n- Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings\\\\n\\\\n### For external processing\\\\n\\\\n### For legal reasons\\\\n\\\\nWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\\\\n\\\\n- Respond to any applicable law, regulation,legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.\\\\n\\\\n- Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.\\\\n\\\\n- Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public.\\\\n\\\\nWe may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.\\\\n\\\\n# Keeping your information secure\\\\n\\\\n## We build security into our services to protect your information\\\\n\\\\nAll Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.\\\\n\\\\nWe work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:\\\\n\\\\n- We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit\\\\n\\\\n- We offer a range of security features, like Safe Browsing, Security Checkup, and 2 Step Verification to help you protect your account\\\\n\\\\n- We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems\\\\n\\\\n- We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.\\\\n\\\\n# Exporting & deleting your information\\\\n\\\\nYou can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your content from specific Google services\\\\n\\\\n- Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\\\\n\\\\n- Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your entire Google Account\\\\n\\\\n# Retaining your information\\\\n\\\\nWe retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:\\\\n\\\\n- Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your personal info or the content you create or upload, like photos and documents. You can also delete activity information saved in your account, or choose to have it deleted automatically after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.\\\\n\\\\n- Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as advertising data in server logs.\\\\n\\\\n- We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.\\\\n\\\\n- And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.\\\\n\\\\n# Compliance & cooperation with regulators\\\\n\\\\n## Data transfers\\\\n\\\\nWe maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data.\\\\n\\\\nWhen we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.\\\\n\\\\n## U.S. state law requirements\\\\n\\\\nSome U.S. state privacy laws require specific disclosures.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain the categories of information Google collects and the sources of that information in Information Google collects.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain the purposes for which Google collects and uses information in Why Google collects data.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain when Google may disclose information in Sharing your information. Google does not sell your personal information. Google also does not “share” your personal information as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\\\\n\\\\n- We explain how Google retains information in Retaining your information. You can also learn more about how Google anonymizes data. As described there, when Google anonymizes data to protect your privacy, we maintain policies and technical measures to avoid re-identifying that information.\\\\n\\\\nU.S. state privacy laws also provide the right to request information about how Google collects, uses, and discloses your information. And they give you the right to access your information, sometimes in a portable format; correct your information; and to request that Google delete that information. Many of these laws also provide the right to opt out of certain forms of profiling and targeted advertising.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy.

The nascent company was merely a search engine, and Gmail, Android and YouTube were but glimmers in the startup’s eye. Google’s first privacy policy reflected that simplicity. It was short and earnest, a quaint artifact of a different time in Silicon Valley, when Google offered 600 words to explain how it was collecting and using personal information.\\\\n\\\\nThat version of the internet (and Google) is gone. Over the past 20 years, that same privacy policy has been rewritten into a sprawling 4,000-word explanation of the company’s data practices.\\\\n\\\\nThis evolution, across two decades and 30 versions, is the story of the internet’s transformation through the eyes of one of its most crucial entities. The web is now terribly complex, and Google has a privacy policy to match.\\\\n\\\\nGoogle’s Privacy Policy Over Time 1999 Google is sensitive to the privacy concerns of its users. The Internet allows individuals to explore and communicate with unprecedented ease, but it also allows websites to collect and distribute personal information with equal ease. We at Google know that many users are, understandably, concerned about such practices, and we wish to make clear our policy for collecting and using personal information. Google’s Policy Google’s policy on our wholly controlled and operated Internet sites is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. Google does not willfully disclose individually identifiable information about its customers to any third party without first receiving that customer’s permission. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it. Google may share information about users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we only talk about our users in aggregate, not as individuals. For example, we may disclose how frequently the average Google user visits Google, or which other query words are most often used with the query word “Microsoft.” From time to time, there may be situations where Google asks you for personal information. When we intend to use your personal information, we tell you up front. This way you can decide whether you want to give us the information or not. In case you change your mind or some personal information changes, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us. Google and Cookies Upon your first visit to Google, Google sends a “cookie” to your computer. A cookie is a file that identifies you as a unique user. It can also store personal preferences and user data. A cookie can tell us, “This is the same individual who visited Google two days ago” but it cannot tell us, “This person is Joe Smith” or even, “This person lives in the United States.” Google uses cookies to track user trends and patterns, in order to better understand our user base and to improve the quality of our service. Google may also choose to use cookies to store user preferences. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of Google may not function properly if you refuse cookies. Links to Other Sites The page that comes up after “clicking” on a result URL is likely to be outside the Google site and beyond our control. Other links, such as for the Google-friends mailing list archive, are also on sites not controlled by Google. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Google may choose to exhibit its search results in the form of a “URL redirecter.” When a URL redirecter is used, whenever you “click” on a URL from a search result, information about the “click” is sent to Google, which then sends you to the site you clicked on. Google uses this URL information to understand and improve the quality of Google’s search technology. For instance, Google uses this information to determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results. Google’s policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Google’s control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. We reserve the right at our discretion to make changes to this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. 2009 At Google we recognize that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by Google Inc. or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies except DoubleClick (DoubleClick Privacy Policy) and Postini (Postini Privacy Policy); collectively, Google’s “services.” In addition, where more detailed information is needed to explain our privacy practices, we post supplementary privacy notices to describe how particular services process personal information. These notices can be found in the Google Privacy Center. Google adheres to the US Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement, and is registered with the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor Program. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us through our website or write to us at Privacy Matters c/o Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, California, 94043 USA Information we collect and how we use it We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information to us, such as Google Search. In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information: Information you provide – When you sign up for a Google Account or other Google service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password). For certain services, such as our advertising programs, we also request credit card or other payment account information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers. We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other Google services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information. Cookies – When you visit Google, we send one or more cookies – a small file containing a string of characters – to your computer or other device that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, improving search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends, such as how people search. Google also uses cookies in its advertising services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. We may set one or more cookies in your browser when you visit a website, including Google sites that use our advertising cookies, and view or click on an ad supported by Google’s advertising services. Log information – When you access Google services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. User communications – When you send email or other communications to Google, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. Affiliated Google Services on other sites – We offer some of our services on or through other web sites. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to Google in order to deliver the service. We process such information under this Privacy Policy. The affiliated sites through which our services are offered may have different privacy practices and we encourage you to read their privacy policies. Gadgets – Google may make available third party applications through its services. The information collected by Google when you enable a gadget or other application is processed under this Privacy Policy. Information collected by the application or gadget provider is governed by their privacy policies. Location data – Google offers location-enabled services, such as Google Maps for mobile. If you use those services, Google may receive information about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate a location (such as a cell ID). Links – Google may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality of our search technology, customized content and advertising. Read more information about links and redirected URLs. Other sites – This Privacy Policy applies to Google services only. We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as search results, sites that include Google applications, products or services, or links from within our various services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Google only processes personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and/or the supplementary privacy notices for specific services. In addition to the above, such purposes include: Providing our services, including the display of customized content and advertising; Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services; Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; Protecting the rights or property of Google or our users; and Developing new services. You can find more information about how we process personal information by referring to the supplementary privacy notices for particular services. Google processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country. We may process personal information to provide our own services. In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising partners. Choices for personal information When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service privacy notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the supplementary service privacy notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Google features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. Google uses the DoubleClick advertising cookie on AdSense partner sites and certain Google services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. You can view, edit, and manage your ads preferences associated with this cookie by accessing the Ads Preferences Manager. In addition, you may choose to opt out of the DoubleClick cookie at any time by using DoubleClick’s opt-out cookie. You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case Google may not be able to provide those services to you. Information sharing Google only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Google in the following limited circumstances: We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information. We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, its users or the public as required or permitted by law. If Google becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually. Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data. Information security We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. Data integrity Google processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services or as otherwise permitted under this Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary. Accessing and updating personal information When you use Google services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users’ personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services. Enforcement Google regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or Google’s treatment of personal information by contacting us through this web site or by writing to us at Privacy Matters c/o Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, California, 94043 USA When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is Google’s policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Google and an individual. Changes to this Privacy Policy Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). Each version of this Privacy Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and we will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review. If you have any additional questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us any time through this web site or at 2019 When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.

Our services include: Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads and embedded Google Maps You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used. To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us. INFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls. When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions. When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information. Things you create or provide to us When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services.

We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request. We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and which apps you've installed. Your activity We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include: Terms you search for Videos you watch Views and interactions with content and ads Voice and audio information when you use audio features Purchase activity People with whom you communicate or share content Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services Chrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account If you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types of calls. You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account. Go to Google Account Your location information We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions for your weekend getaway or showtimes for movies playing near you. Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by: GPS IP address Sensor data from your device Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Google’s Policy Google’s policy on our wholly controlled and operated Internet sites is to respect and protect the privacy of our users.

And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\\\\n\\\\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\\\\n\\\\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\\\\n\\\\n# Why Google collects data\\\\n\\\\n## We use data to build better services\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\\\\n\\\\n### Provide our services\\\\n\\\\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\\\\n\\\\n### Maintain & improve our services\\\\n\\\\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\\\\n\\\\n### Develop new services\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\\\\n\\\\n### Provide personalized services, including content and ads\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\\\\n\\\\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\\\\n\\\\nGo to My Ad Center\\\\n\\\\n### Measure performance\\\\n\\\\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\\\\n\\\\n### Communicate with you\\\\n\\\\n### Protect Google, our users, and the public\\\\n\\\\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\\\\n\\\\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\\\\n\\\\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.\\\\n\\\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\\\\n\\\\n# Your privacy controls\\\\n\\\\n## You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\\\\n\\\\nGo to Privacy Checkup\\\\n\\\\n## Managing, reviewing, and updating your information\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.\\\\n\\\\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:\\\\n\\\\n### Privacy controls\\\\n\\\\n### Activity Controls\\\\n\\\\nDecide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Activity Controls\\\\n\\\\n### Ad settings\\\\n\\\\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. You can modify your interests, choose whether your personal information is used to make ads more relevant to you, and turn on or off certain advertising services.\\\\n\\\\n### About you\\\\n\\\\nManage personal info in your Google Account and control who can see it across Google services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to About You\\\\n\\\\n### Shared endorsements\\\\n\\\\nChoose whether your name and photo appear next to your activity, like reviews and recommendations, that appear in ads.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Shared Endorsements\\\\n\\\\n### Sites and apps that use Google services\\\\n\\\\nManage information that websites and apps using Google services, like Google Analytics, may share with Google when you visit or interact with their services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services\\\\n\\\\n### Ways to review & update your information\\\\n\\\\n### My Activity\\\\n\\\\nMy Activity allows you to review and control data that’s saved to your Google Account when you’re signed in and using Google services, like searches you’ve done or your visits to Google Play. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.\\\\n\\\\nGo to My Activity\\\\n\\\\n### Google Dashboard\\\\n\\\\nGoogle Dashboard allows you to manage information associated with specific products.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Dashboard\\\\n\\\\n### Your personal information\\\\n\\\\nManage your contact information, such as your name, email, and phone number.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Personal Info\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed out, you can manage information associated with your browser or device, including:\\\\n\\\\n- Signed-out search personalization: Choose whether your search activity is used to offer you more relevant results and recommendations.\\\\n\\\\n- YouTube settings: Pause and delete your YouTube Search History and your YouTube Watch History.\\\\n\\\\n- Ad Settings: Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.\\\\n\\\\n## Exporting, removing & deleting your information\\\\n\\\\nYou can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.\\\\n\\\\nExport your data\\\\n\\\\nTo delete your information, you can:\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your content from specific Google services\\\\n\\\\n- Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\\\\n\\\\n- Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your entire Google Account\\\\n\\\\nDelete your information\\\\n\\\\nInactive Account Manager allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account.\\\\n\\\\nAnd finally, you can also request to remove content from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.\\\\n\\\\nThere are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:\\\\n\\\\n- Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a cookie in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.\\\\n\\\\n- Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\\\\n\\\\n# Sharing your information\\\\n\\\\n## When you share your information\\\\n\\\\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.\\\\n\\\\n## When Google shares your information\\\\n\\\\nWe do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:\\\\n\\\\n### With your consent\\\\n\\\\nWe’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.\\\\n\\\\n### With domain administrators\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:\\\\n\\\\n- Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email\\\\n\\\\n- View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install\\\\n\\\\n- Change your account password\\\\n\\\\n- Suspend or terminate your account access\\\\n\\\\n- Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request\\\\n\\\\n- Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings\\\\n\\\\n### For external processing\\\\n\\\\n### For legal reasons\\\\n\\\\nWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\\\\n\\\\n- Respond to any applicable law, regulation,legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.\\\\n\\\\n- Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.\\\\n\\\\n- Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public.\\\\n\\\\nWe may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.\\\\n\\\\n# Keeping your information secure\\\\n\\\\n## We build security into our services to protect your information\\\\n\\\\nAll Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.\\\\n\\\\nWe work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:\\\\n\\\\n- We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit\\\\n\\\\n- We offer a range of security features, like Safe Browsing, Security Checkup, and 2 Step Verification to help you protect your account\\\\n\\\\n- We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems\\\\n\\\\n- We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.\\\\n\\\\n# Exporting & deleting your information\\\\n\\\\nYou can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your content from specific Google services\\\\n\\\\n- Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\\\\n\\\\n- Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your entire Google Account\\\\n\\\\n# Retaining your information\\\\n\\\\nWe retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:\\\\n\\\\n- Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your personal info or the content you create or upload, like photos and documents. You can also delete activity information saved in your account, or choose to have it deleted automatically after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.\\\\n\\\\n- Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as advertising data in server logs.\\\\n\\\\n- We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.\\\\n\\\\n- And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.\\\\n\\\\n# Compliance & cooperation with regulators\\\\n\\\\n## Data transfers\\\\n\\\\nWe maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data.\\\\n\\\\nWhen we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.\\\\n\\\\n## U.S. state law requirements\\\\n\\\\nSome U.S. state privacy laws require specific disclosures.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain the categories of information Google collects and the sources of that information in Information Google collects.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain the purposes for which Google collects and uses information in Why Google collects data.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain when Google may disclose information in Sharing your information. Google does not sell your personal information. Google also does not “share” your personal information as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\\\\n\\\\n- We explain how Google retains information in Retaining your information. You can also learn more about how Google anonymizes data. As described there, when Google anonymizes data to protect your privacy, we maintain policies and technical measures to avoid re-identifying that information.\\\\n\\\\nU.S. state privacy laws also provide the right to request information about how Google collects, uses, and discloses your information. And they give you the right to access your information, sometimes in a portable format; correct your information; and to request that Google delete that information. Many of these laws also provide the right to opt out of certain forms of profiling and targeted advertising.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy.

The first time you turn on Location History — which is off by default — your auto-delete option will be set to 18 months by default. Web & App Activity auto-delete will also default to 18 months for new accounts. This means your activity data will be automatically and continuously deleted after 18 months, rather than kept until you choose to delete it.

DO NOT EDIT. ======================================================\\\\n\\\\nthis file is generated from src/style.less\\\\n\\\\nOpinionThe Privacy Project Google’s 4,000-Word Privacy Policy Is a Secret History of the Internet By Charlie Warzel and Ash Ngu Illustrated by Rose Wong\\\\n\\\\nThe late 1990s was a simpler time for Google. The nascent company was merely a search engine, and Gmail, Android and YouTube were but glimmers in the startup’s eye. Google’s first privacy policy reflected that simplicity. It was short and earnest, a quaint artifact of a different time in Silicon Valley, when Google offered 600 words to explain how it was collecting and using personal information.\\\\n\\\\nThat version of the internet (and Google) is gone. Over the past 20 years, that same privacy policy has been rewritten into a sprawling 4,000-word explanation of the company’s data practices.\\\\n\\\\nThis evolution, across two decades and 30 versions, is the story of the internet’s transformation through the eyes of one of its most crucial entities. The web is now terribly complex, and Google has a privacy policy to match.\\\\n\\\\nGoogle’s Privacy Policy Over Time 1999 Google is sensitive to the privacy concerns of its users. The Internet allows individuals to explore and communicate with unprecedented ease, but it also allows websites to collect and distribute personal information with equal ease. We at Google know that many users are, understandably, concerned about such practices, and we wish to make clear our policy for collecting and using personal information. Google’s Policy Google’s policy on our wholly controlled and operated Internet sites is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. Google does not willfully disclose individually identifiable information about its customers to any third party without first receiving that customer’s permission. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it. Google may share information about users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we only talk about our users in aggregate, not as individuals. For example, we may disclose how frequently the average Google user visits Google, or which other query words are most often used with the query word “Microsoft.” From time to time, there may be situations where Google asks you for personal information. When we intend to use your personal information, we tell you up front. This way you can decide whether you want to give us the information or not. In case you change your mind or some personal information changes, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us. Google and Cookies Upon your first visit to Google, Google sends a “cookie” to your computer. A cookie is a file that identifies you as a unique user. It can also store personal preferences and user data. A cookie can tell us, “This is the same individual who visited Google two days ago” but it cannot tell us, “This person is Joe Smith” or even, “This person lives in the United States.” Google uses cookies to track user trends and patterns, in order to better understand our user base and to improve the quality of our service. Google may also choose to use cookies to store user preferences. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of Google may not function properly if you refuse cookies. Links to Other Sites The page that comes up after “clicking” on a result URL is likely to be outside the Google site and beyond our control. Other links, such as for the Google-friends mailing list archive, are also on sites not controlled by Google. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Google may choose to exhibit its search results in the form of a “URL redirecter.” When a URL redirecter is used, whenever you “click” on a URL from a search result, information about the “click” is sent to Google, which then sends you to the site you clicked on. Google uses this URL information to understand and improve the quality of Google’s search technology. For instance, Google uses this information to determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results. Google’s policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Google’s control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. We reserve the right at our discretion to make changes to this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. 2009 At Google we recognize that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by Google Inc. or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies except DoubleClick (DoubleClick Privacy Policy) and Postini (Postini Privacy Policy); collectively, Google’s “services.” In addition, where more detailed information is needed to explain our privacy practices, we post supplementary privacy notices to describe how particular services process personal information. These notices can be found in the Google Privacy Center. Google adheres to the US Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement, and is registered with the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor Program. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us through our website or write to us at Privacy Matters c/o Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, California, 94043 USA Information we collect and how we use it We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information to us, such as Google Search. In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information: Information you provide – When you sign up for a Google Account or other Google service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password). For certain services, such as our advertising programs, we also request credit card or other payment account information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers. We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other Google services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information. Cookies – When you visit Google, we send one or more cookies – a small file containing a string of characters – to your computer or other device that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, improving search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends, such as how people search. Google also uses cookies in its advertising services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. We may set one or more cookies in your browser when you visit a website, including Google sites that use our advertising cookies, and view or click on an ad supported by Google’s advertising services. Log information – When you access Google services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. User communications – When you send email or other communications to Google, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. Affiliated Google Services on other sites – We offer some of our services on or through other web sites. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to Google in order to deliver the service. We process such information under this Privacy Policy. The affiliated sites through which our services are offered may have different privacy practices and we encourage you to read their privacy policies. Gadgets – Google may make available third party applications through its services. The information collected by Google when you enable a gadget or other application is processed under this Privacy Policy. Information collected by the application or gadget provider is governed by their privacy policies. Location data – Google offers location-enabled services, such as Google Maps for mobile. If you use those services, Google may receive information about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate a location (such as a cell ID). Links – Google may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality of our search technology, customized content and advertising. Read more information about links and redirected URLs. Other sites – This Privacy Policy applies to Google services only. We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as search results, sites that include Google applications, products or services, or links from within our various services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Google only processes personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and/or the supplementary privacy notices for specific services. In addition to the above, such purposes include: Providing our services, including the display of customized content and advertising; Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services; Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; Protecting the rights or property of Google or our users; and Developing new services. You can find more information about how we process personal information by referring to the supplementary privacy notices for particular services. Google processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country. We may process personal information to provide our own services. In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising partners. Choices for personal information When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service privacy notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the supplementary service privacy notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Google features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. Google uses the DoubleClick advertising cookie on AdSense partner sites and certain Google services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. You can view, edit, and manage your ads preferences associated with this cookie by accessing the Ads Preferences Manager. In addition, you may choose to opt out of the DoubleClick cookie at any time by using DoubleClick’s opt-out cookie. You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case Google may not be able to provide those services to you. Information sharing Google only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Google in the following limited circumstances: We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information. We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, its users or the public as required or permitted by law. If Google becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually. Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data. Information security We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. Data integrity Google processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services or as otherwise permitted under this Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary. Accessing and updating personal information When you use Google services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users’ personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services. Enforcement Google regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or Google’s treatment of personal information by contacting us through this web site or by writing to us at Privacy Matters c/o Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, California, 94043 USA When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is Google’s policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Google and an individual. Changes to this Privacy Policy Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). Each version of this Privacy Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and we will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review. If you have any additional questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us any time through this web site or at 2019 When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information. Effective January 22, 2019 | Archived versions | Download PDF We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include: Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads and embedded Google Maps You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used. To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us. INFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls. When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions. When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information. Things you create or provide to us When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services. We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos. Information we collect as you use our services Your apps, browsers & devices We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low. The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request. We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and which apps you've installed. Your activity We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include: Terms you search for Videos you watch Views and interactions with content and ads Voice and audio information when you use audio features Purchase activity People with whom you communicate or share content Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services Chrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account If you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types of calls. You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account. Go to Google Account Your location information We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions for your weekend getaway or showtimes for movies playing near you. Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by: GPS IP address Sensor data from your device Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Google’s Policy Google’s policy on our wholly controlled and operated Internet sites is to respect and protect the privacy of our users.

The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.\\\\n\\\\n## Things you create or provide to us\\\\n\\\\nWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.\\\\n\\\\nWe also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.\\\\n\\\\n## Information we collect as you use our services\\\\n\\\\n### Your apps, browsers & devices\\\\n\\\\nWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.\\\\n\\\\nThe information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.\\\\n\\\\nWe collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you’re using your Android device.\\\\n\\\\n### Your activity\\\\n\\\\nWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:\\\\n\\\\n- Terms you search for\\\\n\\\\n- Videos you watch\\\\n\\\\n- Views and interactions with content and ads\\\\n\\\\n- Voice and audio information\\\\n\\\\n- Purchase activity\\\\n\\\\n- People with whom you communicate or share content\\\\n\\\\n- Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\\\\n\\\\n- Chrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account\\\\n\\\\nIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.\\\\n\\\\nYou can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Google Account\\\\n\\\\n### Your location information\\\\n\\\\nWe collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.\\\\n\\\\nDepending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:\\\\n\\\\n- GPS and other sensor data from your device\\\\n\\\\n- IP address\\\\n\\\\n- Activity on Google services, such as from your searches or places you label like home or work\\\\n\\\\n- Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices\\\\n\\\\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Timeline if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\\\\n\\\\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\\\\n\\\\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\\\\n\\\\n# Why Google collects data\\\\n\\\\n## We use data to build better services\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\\\\n\\\\n### Provide our services\\\\n\\\\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\\\\n\\\\n### Maintain & improve our services\\\\n\\\\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\\\\n\\\\n### Develop new services\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\\\\n\\\\n### Provide personalized services, including content and ads\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\\\\n\\\\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\\\\n\\\\nGo to My Ad Center\\\\n\\\\n### Measure performance\\\\n\\\\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\\\\n\\\\n### Communicate with you\\\\n\\\\n### Protect Google, our users, and the public\\\\n\\\\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\\\\n\\\\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\\\\n\\\\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.\\\\n\\\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\\\\n\\\\n# Your privacy controls\\\\n\\\\n## You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\\\\n\\\\nGo to Privacy Checkup\\\\n\\\\n## Managing, reviewing, and updating your information\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.\\\\n\\\\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:\\\\n\\\\n### Privacy controls\\\\n\\\\n### Activity Controls\\\\n\\\\nDecide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Activity Controls\\\\n\\\\n### Ad settings\\\\n\\\\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. You can modify your interests, choose whether your personal information is used to make ads more relevant to you, and turn on or off certain advertising services.\\\\n\\\\n### About you\\\\n\\\\nManage personal info in your Google Account and control who can see it across Google services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to About You\\\\n\\\\n### Shared endorsements\\\\n\\\\nChoose whether your name and photo appear next to your activity, like reviews and recommendations, that appear in ads.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Shared Endorsements\\\\n\\\\n### Sites and apps that use Google services\\\\n\\\\nManage information that websites and apps using Google services, like Google Analytics, may share with Google when you visit or interact with their services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services\\\\n\\\\n### Ways to review & update your information\\\\n\\\\n### My Activity\\\\n\\\\nMy Activity allows you to review and control data that’s saved to your Google Account when you’re signed in and using Google services, like searches you’ve done or your visits to Google Play. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.\\\\n\\\\nGo to My Activity\\\\n\\\\n### Google Dashboard\\\\n\\\\nGoogle Dashboard allows you to manage information associated with specific products.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Dashboard\\\\n\\\\n### Your personal information\\\\n\\\\nManage your contact information, such as your name, email, and phone number.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Personal Info\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed out, you can manage information associated with your browser or device, including:\\\\n\\\\n- Signed-out search personalization: Choose whether your search activity is used to offer you more relevant results and recommendations.\\\\n\\\\n- YouTube settings: Pause and delete your YouTube Search History and your YouTube Watch History.\\\\n\\\\n- Ad Settings: Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.\\\\n\\\\n## Exporting, removing & deleting your information\\\\n\\\\nYou can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.\\\\n\\\\nExport your data\\\\n\\\\nTo delete your information, you can:\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your content from specific Google services\\\\n\\\\n- Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\\\\n\\\\n- Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your entire Google Account\\\\n\\\\nDelete your information\\\\n\\\\nInactive Account Manager allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account.\\\\n\\\\nAnd finally, you can also request to remove content from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.\\\\n\\\\nThere are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:\\\\n\\\\n- Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a cookie in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.\\\\n\\\\n- Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\\\\n\\\\n# Sharing your information\\\\n\\\\n## When you share your information\\\\n\\\\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.\\\\n\\\\n## When Google shares your information\\\\n\\\\nWe do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:\\\\n\\\\n### With your consent\\\\n\\\\nWe’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.\\\\n\\\\n### With domain administrators\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:\\\\n\\\\n- Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email\\\\n\\\\n- View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install\\\\n\\\\n- Change your account password\\\\n\\\\n- Suspend or terminate your account access\\\\n\\\\n- Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request\\\\n\\\\n- Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings\\\\n\\\\n### For external processing\\\\n\\\\n### For legal reasons\\\\n\\\\nWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\\\\n\\\\n- Respond to any applicable law, regulation,legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.\\\\n\\\\n- Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.\\\\n\\\\n- Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public.\\\\n\\\\nWe may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.\\\\n\\\\n# Keeping your information secure\\\\n\\\\n## We build security into our services to protect your information\\\\n\\\\nAll Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.\\\\n\\\\nWe work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:\\\\n\\\\n- We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit\\\\n\\\\n- We offer a range of security features, like Safe Browsing, Security Checkup, and 2 Step Verification to help you protect your account\\\\n\\\\n- We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems\\\\n\\\\n- We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.\\\\n\\\\n# Exporting & deleting your information\\\\n\\\\nYou can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your content from specific Google services\\\\n\\\\n- Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\\\\n\\\\n- Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your entire Google Account\\\\n\\\\n# Retaining your information\\\\n\\\\nWe retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:\\\\n\\\\n- Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your personal info or the content you create or upload, like photos and documents. You can also delete activity information saved in your account, or choose to have it deleted automatically after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.\\\\n\\\\n- Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as advertising data in server logs.\\\\n\\\\n- We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.\\\\n\\\\n- And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.\\\\n\\\\n# Compliance & cooperation with regulators\\\\n\\\\n## Data transfers\\\\n\\\\nWe maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data.\\\\n\\\\nWhen we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.\\\\n\\\\n## U.S. state law requirements\\\\n\\\\nSome U.S. state privacy laws require specific disclosures.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain the categories of information Google collects and the sources of that information in Information Google collects.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain the purposes for which Google collects and uses information in Why Google collects data.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain when Google may disclose information in Sharing your information. Google does not sell your personal information. Google also does not “share” your personal information as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\\\\n\\\\n- We explain how Google retains information in Retaining your information. You can also learn more about how Google anonymizes data. As described there, when Google anonymizes data to protect your privacy, we maintain policies and technical measures to avoid re-identifying that information.\\\\n\\\\nU.S. state privacy laws also provide the right to request information about how Google collects, uses, and discloses your information. And they give you the right to access your information, sometimes in a portable format; correct your information; and to request that Google delete that information. Many of these laws also provide the right to opt out of certain forms of profiling and targeted advertising.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy.

DO NOT EDIT. ======================================================\\\\n\\\\nthis file is generated from src/style.less\\\\n\\\\nOpinionThe Privacy Project Google’s 4,000-Word Privacy Policy Is a Secret History of the Internet By Charlie Warzel and Ash Ngu Illustrated by Rose Wong\\\\n\\\\nThe late 1990s was a simpler time for Google. The nascent company was merely a search engine, and Gmail, Android and YouTube were but glimmers in the startup’s eye. Google’s first privacy policy reflected that simplicity. It was short and earnest, a quaint artifact of a different time in Silicon Valley, when Google offered 600 words to explain how it was collecting and using personal information.\\\\n\\\\nThat version of the internet (and Google) is gone. Over the past 20 years, that same privacy policy has been rewritten into a sprawling 4,000-word explanation of the company’s data practices.\\\\n\\\\nThis evolution, across two decades and 30 versions, is the story of the internet’s transformation through the eyes of one of its most crucial entities. The web is now terribly complex, and Google has a privacy policy to match.\\\\n\\\\nGoogle’s Privacy Policy Over Time 1999 Google is sensitive to the privacy concerns of its users. The Internet allows individuals to explore and communicate with unprecedented ease, but it also allows websites to collect and distribute personal information with equal ease. We at Google know that many users are, understandably, concerned about such practices, and we wish to make clear our policy for collecting and using personal information. Google’s Policy Google’s policy on our wholly controlled and operated Internet sites is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. Google does not willfully disclose individually identifiable information about its customers to any third party without first receiving that customer’s permission. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it. Google may share information about users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we only talk about our users in aggregate, not as individuals. For example, we may disclose how frequently the average Google user visits Google, or which other query words are most often used with the query word “Microsoft.” From time to time, there may be situations where Google asks you for personal information. When we intend to use your personal information, we tell you up front. This way you can decide whether you want to give us the information or not. In case you change your mind or some personal information changes, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us. Google and Cookies Upon your first visit to Google, Google sends a “cookie” to your computer. A cookie is a file that identifies you as a unique user. It can also store personal preferences and user data. A cookie can tell us, “This is the same individual who visited Google two days ago” but it cannot tell us, “This person is Joe Smith” or even, “This person lives in the United States.” Google uses cookies to track user trends and patterns, in order to better understand our user base and to improve the quality of our service. Google may also choose to use cookies to store user preferences. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of Google may not function properly if you refuse cookies. Links to Other Sites The page that comes up after “clicking” on a result URL is likely to be outside the Google site and beyond our control. Other links, such as for the Google-friends mailing list archive, are also on sites not controlled by Google. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Google may choose to exhibit its search results in the form of a “URL redirecter.” When a URL redirecter is used, whenever you “click” on a URL from a search result, information about the “click” is sent to Google, which then sends you to the site you clicked on. Google uses this URL information to understand and improve the quality of Google’s search technology. For instance, Google uses this information to determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results. Google’s policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Google’s control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. We reserve the right at our discretion to make changes to this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. 2009 At Google we recognize that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by Google Inc. or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies except DoubleClick (DoubleClick Privacy Policy) and Postini (Postini Privacy Policy); collectively, Google’s “services.” In addition, where more detailed information is needed to explain our privacy practices, we post supplementary privacy notices to describe how particular services process personal information. These notices can be found in the Google Privacy Center. Google adheres to the US Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement, and is registered with the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor Program. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us through our website or write to us at Privacy Matters c/o Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, California, 94043 USA Information we collect and how we use it We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information to us, such as Google Search. In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information: Information you provide – When you sign up for a Google Account or other Google service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password). For certain services, such as our advertising programs, we also request credit card or other payment account information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers. We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other Google services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information. Cookies – When you visit Google, we send one or more cookies – a small file containing a string of characters – to your computer or other device that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, improving search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends, such as how people search. Google also uses cookies in its advertising services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. We may set one or more cookies in your browser when you visit a website, including Google sites that use our advertising cookies, and view or click on an ad supported by Google’s advertising services. Log information – When you access Google services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. User communications – When you send email or other communications to Google, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. Affiliated Google Services on other sites – We offer some of our services on or through other web sites. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to Google in order to deliver the service. We process such information under this Privacy Policy. The affiliated sites through which our services are offered may have different privacy practices and we encourage you to read their privacy policies. Gadgets – Google may make available third party applications through its services. The information collected by Google when you enable a gadget or other application is processed under this Privacy Policy. Information collected by the application or gadget provider is governed by their privacy policies. Location data – Google offers location-enabled services, such as Google Maps for mobile. If you use those services, Google may receive information about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate a location (such as a cell ID). Links – Google may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality of our search technology, customized content and advertising. Read more information about links and redirected URLs. Other sites – This Privacy Policy applies to Google services only. We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as search results, sites that include Google applications, products or services, or links from within our various services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Google only processes personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and/or the supplementary privacy notices for specific services. In addition to the above, such purposes include: Providing our services, including the display of customized content and advertising; Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services; Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; Protecting the rights or property of Google or our users; and Developing new services. You can find more information about how we process personal information by referring to the supplementary privacy notices for particular services. Google processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country. We may process personal information to provide our own services. In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising partners. Choices for personal information When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service privacy notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the supplementary service privacy notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Google features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. Google uses the DoubleClick advertising cookie on AdSense partner sites and certain Google services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. You can view, edit, and manage your ads preferences associated with this cookie by accessing the Ads Preferences Manager. In addition, you may choose to opt out of the DoubleClick cookie at any time by using DoubleClick’s opt-out cookie. You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case Google may not be able to provide those services to you. Information sharing Google only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Google in the following limited circumstances: We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information. We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, its users or the public as required or permitted by law. If Google becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually. Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data. Information security We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. Data integrity Google processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services or as otherwise permitted under this Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary. Accessing and updating personal information When you use Google services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users’ personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services. Enforcement Google regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or Google’s treatment of personal information by contacting us through this web site or by writing to us at Privacy Matters c/o Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, California, 94043 USA When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is Google’s policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Google and an individual. Changes to this Privacy Policy Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). Each version of this Privacy Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and we will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review. If you have any additional questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us any time through this web site or at 2019 When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.

Our services include: Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads and embedded Google Maps You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used. To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us. INFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls. When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions. When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information. Things you create or provide to us When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services.

We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request. We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and which apps you've installed.

You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account. Go to Google Account Your location information We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions for your weekend getaway or showtimes for movies playing near you. Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by: GPS IP address Sensor data from your device Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Google’s Policy Google’s policy on our wholly controlled and operated Internet sites is to respect and protect the privacy of our users.

These include:\\\\n\\\\n- GPS and other sensor data from your device\\\\n\\\\n- IP address\\\\n\\\\n- Activity on Google services, such as from your searches or places you label like home or work\\\\n\\\\n- Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices\\\\n\\\\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Timeline if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\\\\n\\\\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\\\\n\\\\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\\\\n\\\\n# Why Google collects data\\\\n\\\\n## We use data to build better services\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\\\\n\\\\n### Provide our services\\\\n\\\\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\\\\n\\\\n### Maintain & improve our services\\\\n\\\\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\\\\n\\\\n### Develop new services\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\\\\n\\\\n### Provide personalized services, including content and ads\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\\\\n\\\\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\\\\n\\\\nGo to My Ad Center\\\\n\\\\n### Measure performance\\\\n\\\\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\\\\n\\\\n### Communicate with you\\\\n\\\\n### Protect Google, our users, and the public\\\\n\\\\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\\\\n\\\\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\\\\n\\\\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.\\\\n\\\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\\\\n\\\\n# Your privacy controls\\\\n\\\\n## You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\\\\n\\\\nGo to Privacy Checkup\\\\n\\\\n## Managing, reviewing, and updating your information\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.\\\\n\\\\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:\\\\n\\\\n### Privacy controls\\\\n\\\\n### Activity Controls\\\\n\\\\nDecide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Activity Controls\\\\n\\\\n### Ad settings\\\\n\\\\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. You can modify your interests, choose whether your personal information is used to make ads more relevant to you, and turn on or off certain advertising services.\\\\n\\\\n### About you\\\\n\\\\nManage personal info in your Google Account and control who can see it across Google services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to About You\\\\n\\\\n### Shared endorsements\\\\n\\\\nChoose whether your name and photo appear next to your activity, like reviews and recommendations, that appear in ads.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Shared Endorsements\\\\n\\\\n### Sites and apps that use Google services\\\\n\\\\nManage information that websites and apps using Google services, like Google Analytics, may share with Google when you visit or interact with their services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services\\\\n\\\\n### Ways to review & update your information\\\\n\\\\n### My Activity\\\\n\\\\nMy Activity allows you to review and control data that’s saved to your Google Account when you’re signed in and using Google services, like searches you’ve done or your visits to Google Play. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.\\\\n\\\\nGo to My Activity\\\\n\\\\n### Google Dashboard\\\\n\\\\nGoogle Dashboard allows you to manage information associated with specific products.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Dashboard\\\\n\\\\n### Your personal information\\\\n\\\\nManage your contact information, such as your name, email, and phone number.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Personal Info\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed out, you can manage information associated with your browser or device, including:\\\\n\\\\n- Signed-out search personalization: Choose whether your search activity is used to offer you more relevant results and recommendations.\\\\n\\\\n- YouTube settings: Pause and delete your YouTube Search History and your YouTube Watch History.\\\\n\\\\n- Ad Settings: Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.\\\\n\\\\n## Exporting, removing & deleting your information\\\\n\\\\nYou can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.\\\\n\\\\nExport your data\\\\n\\\\nTo delete your information, you can:\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your content from specific Google services\\\\n\\\\n- Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\\\\n\\\\n- Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your entire Google Account\\\\n\\\\nDelete your information\\\\n\\\\nInactive Account Manager allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account.\\\\n\\\\nAnd finally, you can also request to remove content from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.\\\\n\\\\nThere are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:\\\\n\\\\n- Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a cookie in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.\\\\n\\\\n- Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\\\\n\\\\n# Sharing your information\\\\n\\\\n## When you share your information\\\\n\\\\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.\\\\n\\\\n## When Google shares your information\\\\n\\\\nWe do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:\\\\n\\\\n### With your consent\\\\n\\\\nWe’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.\\\\n\\\\n### With domain administrators\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:\\\\n\\\\n- Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email\\\\n\\\\n- View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install\\\\n\\\\n- Change your account password\\\\n\\\\n- Suspend or terminate your account access\\\\n\\\\n- Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request\\\\n\\\\n- Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings\\\\n\\\\n### For external processing\\\\n\\\\n### For legal reasons\\\\n\\\\nWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\\\\n\\\\n- Respond to any applicable law, regulation,legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.\\\\n\\\\n- Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.\\\\n\\\\n- Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public.\\\\n\\\\nWe may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.\\\\n\\\\n# Keeping your information secure\\\\n\\\\n## We build security into our services to protect your information\\\\n\\\\nAll Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.\\\\n\\\\nWe work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:\\\\n\\\\n- We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit\\\\n\\\\n- We offer a range of security features, like Safe Browsing, Security Checkup, and 2 Step Verification to help you protect your account\\\\n\\\\n- We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems\\\\n\\\\n- We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.\\\\n\\\\n# Exporting & deleting your information\\\\n\\\\nYou can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your content from specific Google services\\\\n\\\\n- Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\\\\n\\\\n- Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your entire Google Account\\\\n\\\\n# Retaining your information\\\\n\\\\nWe retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:\\\\n\\\\n- Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your personal info or the content you create or upload, like photos and documents. You can also delete activity information saved in your account, or choose to have it deleted automatically after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.\\\\n\\\\n- Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as advertising data in server logs.\\\\n\\\\n- We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.\\\\n\\\\n- And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.\\\\n\\\\n# Compliance & cooperation with regulators\\\\n\\\\n## Data transfers\\\\n\\\\nWe maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data.\\\\n\\\\nWhen we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.\\\\n\\\\n## U.S. state law requirements\\\\n\\\\nSome U.S. state privacy laws require specific disclosures.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain the categories of information Google collects and the sources of that information in Information Google collects.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain the purposes for which Google collects and uses information in Why Google collects data.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain when Google may disclose information in Sharing your information. Google does not sell your personal information. Google also does not “share” your personal information as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\\\\n\\\\n- We explain how Google retains information in Retaining your information. You can also learn more about how Google anonymizes data. As described there, when Google anonymizes data to protect your privacy, we maintain policies and technical measures to avoid re-identifying that information.\\\\n\\\\nU.S. state privacy laws also provide the right to request information about how Google collects, uses, and discloses your information. And they give you the right to access your information, sometimes in a portable format; correct your information; and to request that Google delete that information. Many of these laws also provide the right to opt out of certain forms of profiling and targeted advertising.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy.

The nascent company was merely a search engine, and Gmail, Android and YouTube were but glimmers in the startup’s eye. Google’s first privacy policy reflected that simplicity. It was short and earnest, a quaint artifact of a different time in Silicon Valley, when Google offered 600 words to explain how it was collecting and using personal information.\\\\n\\\\nThat version of the internet (and Google) is gone. Over the past 20 years, that same privacy policy has been rewritten into a sprawling 4,000-word explanation of the company’s data practices.\\\\n\\\\nThis evolution, across two decades and 30 versions, is the story of the internet’s transformation through the eyes of one of its most crucial entities. The web is now terribly complex, and Google has a privacy policy to match.\\\\n\\\\nGoogle’s Privacy Policy Over Time 1999 Google is sensitive to the privacy concerns of its users. The Internet allows individuals to explore and communicate with unprecedented ease, but it also allows websites to collect and distribute personal information with equal ease. We at Google know that many users are, understandably, concerned about such practices, and we wish to make clear our policy for collecting and using personal information. Google’s Policy Google’s policy on our wholly controlled and operated Internet sites is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. Google does not willfully disclose individually identifiable information about its customers to any third party without first receiving that customer’s permission. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it. Google may share information about users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we only talk about our users in aggregate, not as individuals. For example, we may disclose how frequently the average Google user visits Google, or which other query words are most often used with the query word “Microsoft.” From time to time, there may be situations where Google asks you for personal information. When we intend to use your personal information, we tell you up front. This way you can decide whether you want to give us the information or not. In case you change your mind or some personal information changes, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us. Google and Cookies Upon your first visit to Google, Google sends a “cookie” to your computer. A cookie is a file that identifies you as a unique user. It can also store personal preferences and user data. A cookie can tell us, “This is the same individual who visited Google two days ago” but it cannot tell us, “This person is Joe Smith” or even, “This person lives in the United States.” Google uses cookies to track user trends and patterns, in order to better understand our user base and to improve the quality of our service. Google may also choose to use cookies to store user preferences. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of Google may not function properly if you refuse cookies. Links to Other Sites The page that comes up after “clicking” on a result URL is likely to be outside the Google site and beyond our control. Other links, such as for the Google-friends mailing list archive, are also on sites not controlled by Google. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Google may choose to exhibit its search results in the form of a “URL redirecter.” When a URL redirecter is used, whenever you “click” on a URL from a search result, information about the “click” is sent to Google, which then sends you to the site you clicked on. Google uses this URL information to understand and improve the quality of Google’s search technology. For instance, Google uses this information to determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results. Google’s policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Google’s control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. We reserve the right at our discretion to make changes to this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. 2009 At Google we recognize that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by Google Inc. or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies except DoubleClick (DoubleClick Privacy Policy) and Postini (Postini Privacy Policy); collectively, Google’s “services.” In addition, where more detailed information is needed to explain our privacy practices, we post supplementary privacy notices to describe how particular services process personal information. These notices can be found in the Google Privacy Center. Google adheres to the US Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement, and is registered with the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor Program. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us through our website or write to us at Privacy Matters c/o Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, California, 94043 USA Information we collect and how we use it We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information to us, such as Google Search. In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information: Information you provide – When you sign up for a Google Account or other Google service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password). For certain services, such as our advertising programs, we also request credit card or other payment account information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers. We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other Google services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information. Cookies – When you visit Google, we send one or more cookies – a small file containing a string of characters – to your computer or other device that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, improving search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends, such as how people search. Google also uses cookies in its advertising services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. We may set one or more cookies in your browser when you visit a website, including Google sites that use our advertising cookies, and view or click on an ad supported by Google’s advertising services. Log information – When you access Google services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. User communications – When you send email or other communications to Google, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. Affiliated Google Services on other sites – We offer some of our services on or through other web sites. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to Google in order to deliver the service. We process such information under this Privacy Policy. The affiliated sites through which our services are offered may have different privacy practices and we encourage you to read their privacy policies. Gadgets – Google may make available third party applications through its services. The information collected by Google when you enable a gadget or other application is processed under this Privacy Policy. Information collected by the application or gadget provider is governed by their privacy policies. Location data – Google offers location-enabled services, such as Google Maps for mobile. If you use those services, Google may receive information about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate a location (such as a cell ID). Links – Google may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality of our search technology, customized content and advertising. Read more information about links and redirected URLs. Other sites – This Privacy Policy applies to Google services only. We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as search results, sites that include Google applications, products or services, or links from within our various services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Google only processes personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and/or the supplementary privacy notices for specific services. In addition to the above, such purposes include: Providing our services, including the display of customized content and advertising; Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services; Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; Protecting the rights or property of Google or our users; and Developing new services. You can find more information about how we process personal information by referring to the supplementary privacy notices for particular services. Google processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country. We may process personal information to provide our own services. In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising partners. Choices for personal information When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service privacy notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the supplementary service privacy notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Google features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. Google uses the DoubleClick advertising cookie on AdSense partner sites and certain Google services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. You can view, edit, and manage your ads preferences associated with this cookie by accessing the Ads Preferences Manager. In addition, you may choose to opt out of the DoubleClick cookie at any time by using DoubleClick’s opt-out cookie. You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case Google may not be able to provide those services to you. Information sharing Google only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Google in the following limited circumstances: We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information. We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, its users or the public as required or permitted by law. If Google becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually. Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data. Information security We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. Data integrity Google processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services or as otherwise permitted under this Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary. Accessing and updating personal information When you use Google services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users’ personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services. Enforcement Google regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or Google’s treatment of personal information by contacting us through this web site or by writing to us at Privacy Matters c/o Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, California, 94043 USA When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is Google’s policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Google and an individual. Changes to this Privacy Policy Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). Each version of this Privacy Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and we will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review. If you have any additional questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us any time through this web site or at 2019 When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information. Effective January 22, 2019 | Archived versions | Download PDF We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include: Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads and embedded Google Maps You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used. To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us. INFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls. When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions. When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information. Things you create or provide to us When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services. We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.

We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request. We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and which apps you've installed. Your activity We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like.

You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account. Go to Google Account Your location information We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions for your weekend getaway or showtimes for movies playing near you. Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by: GPS IP address Sensor data from your device Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Google’s Policy Google’s policy on our wholly controlled and operated Internet sites is to respect and protect the privacy of our users.

And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\\\\n\\\\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\\\\n\\\\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\\\\n\\\\n# Why Google collects data\\\\n\\\\n## We use data to build better services\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\\\\n\\\\n### Provide our services\\\\n\\\\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\\\\n\\\\n### Maintain & improve our services\\\\n\\\\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\\\\n\\\\n### Develop new services\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\\\\n\\\\n### Provide personalized services, including content and ads\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\\\\n\\\\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\\\\n\\\\nGo to My Ad Center\\\\n\\\\n### Measure performance\\\\n\\\\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\\\\n\\\\n### Communicate with you\\\\n\\\\n### Protect Google, our users, and the public\\\\n\\\\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\\\\n\\\\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\\\\n\\\\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.\\\\n\\\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\\\\n\\\\n# Your privacy controls\\\\n\\\\n## You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\\\\n\\\\nGo to Privacy Checkup\\\\n\\\\n## Managing, reviewing, and updating your information\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.\\\\n\\\\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:\\\\n\\\\n### Privacy controls\\\\n\\\\n### Activity Controls\\\\n\\\\nDecide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Activity Controls\\\\n\\\\n### Ad settings\\\\n\\\\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.

You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.\\\\n\\\\n- Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\\\\n\\\\n# Sharing your information\\\\n\\\\n## When you share your information\\\\n\\\\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.\\\\n\\\\n## When Google shares your information\\\\n\\\\nWe do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:\\\\n\\\\n### With your consent\\\\n\\\\nWe’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.\\\\n\\\\n### With domain administrators\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:\\\\n\\\\n- Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email\\\\n\\\\n- View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install\\\\n\\\\n- Change your account password\\\\n\\\\n- Suspend or terminate your account access\\\\n\\\\n- Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request\\\\n\\\\n- Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings\\\\n\\\\n### For external processing\\\\n\\\\n### For legal reasons\\\\n\\\\nWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\\\\n\\\\n- Respond to any applicable law, regulation,legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.\\\\n\\\\n- Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.\\\\n\\\\n- Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public.\\\\n\\\\nWe may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.\\\\n\\\\n# Keeping your information secure\\\\n\\\\n## We build security into our services to protect your information\\\\n\\\\nAll Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.\\\\n\\\\nWe work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:\\\\n\\\\n- We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit\\\\n\\\\n- We offer a range of security features, like Safe Browsing, Security Checkup, and 2 Step Verification to help you protect your account\\\\n\\\\n- We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems\\\\n\\\\n- We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.\\\\n\\\\n# Exporting & deleting your information\\\\n\\\\nYou can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your content from specific Google services\\\\n\\\\n- Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\\\\n\\\\n- Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your entire Google Account\\\\n\\\\n# Retaining your information\\\\n\\\\nWe retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:\\\\n\\\\n- Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your personal info or the content you create or upload, like photos and documents. You can also delete activity information saved in your account, or choose to have it deleted automatically after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.\\\\n\\\\n- Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as advertising data in server logs.\\\\n\\\\n- We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.\\\\n\\\\n- And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.\\\\n\\\\n# Compliance & cooperation with regulators\\\\n\\\\n## Data transfers\\\\n\\\\nWe maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data.\\\\n\\\\nWhen we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.\\\\n\\\\n## U.S. state law requirements\\\\n\\\\nSome U.S. state privacy laws require specific disclosures.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain the categories of information Google collects and the sources of that information in Information Google collects.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain the purposes for which Google collects and uses information in Why Google collects data.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain when Google may disclose information in Sharing your information. Google does not sell your personal information. Google also does not “share” your personal information as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\\\\n\\\\n- We explain how Google retains information in Retaining your information. You can also learn more about how Google anonymizes data. As described there, when Google anonymizes data to protect your privacy, we maintain policies and technical measures to avoid re-identifying that information.\\\\n\\\\nU.S. state privacy laws also provide the right to request information about how Google collects, uses, and discloses your information. And they give you the right to access your information, sometimes in a portable format; correct your information; and to request that Google delete that information. Many of these laws also provide the right to opt out of certain forms of profiling and targeted advertising.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy.

The first time you turn on Location History — which is off by default — your auto-delete option will be set to 18 months by default. Web & App Activity auto-delete will also default to 18 months for new accounts. This means your activity data will be automatically and continuously deleted after 18 months, rather than kept until you choose to delete it.

DO NOT EDIT. ======================================================\\\\n\\\\nthis file is generated from src/style.less\\\\n\\\\nOpinionThe Privacy Project Google’s 4,000-Word Privacy Policy Is a Secret History of the Internet By Charlie Warzel and Ash Ngu Illustrated by Rose Wong\\\\n\\\\nThe late 1990s was a simpler time for Google. The nascent company was merely a search engine, and Gmail, Android and YouTube were but glimmers in the startup’s eye. Google’s first privacy policy reflected that simplicity. It was short and earnest, a quaint artifact of a different time in Silicon Valley, when Google offered 600 words to explain how it was collecting and using personal information.\\\\n\\\\nThat version of the internet (and Google) is gone. Over the past 20 years, that same privacy policy has been rewritten into a sprawling 4,000-word explanation of the company’s data practices.\\\\n\\\\nThis evolution, across two decades and 30 versions, is the story of the internet’s transformation through the eyes of one of its most crucial entities. The web is now terribly complex, and Google has a privacy policy to match.\\\\n\\\\nGoogle’s Privacy Policy Over Time 1999 Google is sensitive to the privacy concerns of its users. The Internet allows individuals to explore and communicate with unprecedented ease, but it also allows websites to collect and distribute personal information with equal ease. We at Google know that many users are, understandably, concerned about such practices, and we wish to make clear our policy for collecting and using personal information. Google’s Policy Google’s policy on our wholly controlled and operated Internet sites is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. Google does not willfully disclose individually identifiable information about its customers to any third party without first receiving that customer’s permission. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it. Google may share information about users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we only talk about our users in aggregate, not as individuals. For example, we may disclose how frequently the average Google user visits Google, or which other query words are most often used with the query word “Microsoft.” From time to time, there may be situations where Google asks you for personal information. When we intend to use your personal information, we tell you up front. This way you can decide whether you want to give us the information or not. In case you change your mind or some personal information changes, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us. Google and Cookies Upon your first visit to Google, Google sends a “cookie” to your computer. A cookie is a file that identifies you as a unique user. It can also store personal preferences and user data. A cookie can tell us, “This is the same individual who visited Google two days ago” but it cannot tell us, “This person is Joe Smith” or even, “This person lives in the United States.” Google uses cookies to track user trends and patterns, in order to better understand our user base and to improve the quality of our service. Google may also choose to use cookies to store user preferences. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of Google may not function properly if you refuse cookies. Links to Other Sites The page that comes up after “clicking” on a result URL is likely to be outside the Google site and beyond our control. Other links, such as for the Google-friends mailing list archive, are also on sites not controlled by Google. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Google may choose to exhibit its search results in the form of a “URL redirecter.” When a URL redirecter is used, whenever you “click” on a URL from a search result, information about the “click” is sent to Google, which then sends you to the site you clicked on. Google uses this URL information to understand and improve the quality of Google’s search technology. For instance, Google uses this information to determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results. Google’s policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Google’s control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. We reserve the right at our discretion to make changes to this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. 2009 At Google we recognize that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by Google Inc. or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies except DoubleClick (DoubleClick Privacy Policy) and Postini (Postini Privacy Policy); collectively, Google’s “services.” In addition, where more detailed information is needed to explain our privacy practices, we post supplementary privacy notices to describe how particular services process personal information. These notices can be found in the Google Privacy Center. Google adheres to the US Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement, and is registered with the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor Program. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us through our website or write to us at Privacy Matters c/o Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, California, 94043 USA Information we collect and how we use it We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information to us, such as Google Search. In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information: Information you provide – When you sign up for a Google Account or other Google service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password). For certain services, such as our advertising programs, we also request credit card or other payment account information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers. We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other Google services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information. Cookies – When you visit Google, we send one or more cookies – a small file containing a string of characters – to your computer or other device that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, improving search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends, such as how people search. Google also uses cookies in its advertising services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. We may set one or more cookies in your browser when you visit a website, including Google sites that use our advertising cookies, and view or click on an ad supported by Google’s advertising services. Log information – When you access Google services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. User communications – When you send email or other communications to Google, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. Affiliated Google Services on other sites – We offer some of our services on or through other web sites. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to Google in order to deliver the service. We process such information under this Privacy Policy. The affiliated sites through which our services are offered may have different privacy practices and we encourage you to read their privacy policies. Gadgets – Google may make available third party applications through its services. The information collected by Google when you enable a gadget or other application is processed under this Privacy Policy. Information collected by the application or gadget provider is governed by their privacy policies. Location data – Google offers location-enabled services, such as Google Maps for mobile. If you use those services, Google may receive information about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate a location (such as a cell ID). Links – Google may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality of our search technology, customized content and advertising. Read more information about links and redirected URLs. Other sites – This Privacy Policy applies to Google services only. We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as search results, sites that include Google applications, products or services, or links from within our various services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Google only processes personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and/or the supplementary privacy notices for specific services. In addition to the above, such purposes include: Providing our services, including the display of customized content and advertising; Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services; Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; Protecting the rights or property of Google or our users; and Developing new services. You can find more information about how we process personal information by referring to the supplementary privacy notices for particular services. Google processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country. We may process personal information to provide our own services. In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising partners. Choices for personal information When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service privacy notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the supplementary service privacy notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Google features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. Google uses the DoubleClick advertising cookie on AdSense partner sites and certain Google services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. You can view, edit, and manage your ads preferences associated with this cookie by accessing the Ads Preferences Manager. In addition, you may choose to opt out of the DoubleClick cookie at any time by using DoubleClick’s opt-out cookie. You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case Google may not be able to provide those services to you. Information sharing Google only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Google in the following limited circumstances: We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information. We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, its users or the public as required or permitted by law. If Google becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually. Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data. Information security We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. Data integrity Google processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services or as otherwise permitted under this Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary. Accessing and updating personal information When you use Google services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users’ personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services. Enforcement Google regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or Google’s treatment of personal information by contacting us through this web site or by writing to us at Privacy Matters c/o Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, California, 94043 USA When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is Google’s policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Google and an individual. Changes to this Privacy Policy Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). Each version of this Privacy Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and we will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review. If you have any additional questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us any time through this web site or at 2019 When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information. Effective January 22, 2019 | Archived versions | Download PDF We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include: Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads and embedded Google Maps You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used. To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us. INFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls. When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions. When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information. Things you create or provide to us When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services. We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos. Information we collect as you use our services Your apps, browsers & devices We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low. The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request. We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and which apps you've installed. Your activity We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include: Terms you search for Videos you watch Views and interactions with content and ads Voice and audio information when you use audio features Purchase activity People with whom you communicate or share content Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services Chrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account If you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types of calls. You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account. Go to Google Account Your location information We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions for your weekend getaway or showtimes for movies playing near you. Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by: GPS IP address Sensor data from your device Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Google’s Policy Google’s policy on our wholly controlled and operated Internet sites is to respect and protect the privacy of our users.

Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.\\\\n\\\\nWe also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.\\\\n\\\\n## Information we collect as you use our services\\\\n\\\\n### Your apps, browsers & devices\\\\n\\\\nWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.\\\\n\\\\nThe information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.\\\\n\\\\nWe collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you’re using your Android device.\\\\n\\\\n### Your activity\\\\n\\\\nWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:\\\\n\\\\n- Terms you search for\\\\n\\\\n- Videos you watch\\\\n\\\\n- Views and interactions with content and ads\\\\n\\\\n- Voice and audio information\\\\n\\\\n- Purchase activity\\\\n\\\\n- People with whom you communicate or share content\\\\n\\\\n- Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\\\\n\\\\n- Chrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account\\\\n\\\\nIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.\\\\n\\\\nYou can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Google Account\\\\n\\\\n### Your location information\\\\n\\\\nWe collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.\\\\n\\\\nDepending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:\\\\n\\\\n- GPS and other sensor data from your device\\\\n\\\\n- IP address\\\\n\\\\n- Activity on Google services, such as from your searches or places you label like home or work\\\\n\\\\n- Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices\\\\n\\\\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Timeline if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\\\\n\\\\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\\\\n\\\\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\\\\n\\\\n# Why Google collects data\\\\n\\\\n## We use data to build better services\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\\\\n\\\\n### Provide our services\\\\n\\\\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\\\\n\\\\n### Maintain & improve our services\\\\n\\\\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\\\\n\\\\n### Develop new services\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\\\\n\\\\n### Provide personalized services, including content and ads\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\\\\n\\\\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\\\\n\\\\nGo to My Ad Center\\\\n\\\\n### Measure performance\\\\n\\\\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\\\\n\\\\n### Communicate with you\\\\n\\\\n### Protect Google, our users, and the public\\\\n\\\\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\\\\n\\\\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\\\\n\\\\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.\\\\n\\\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\\\\n\\\\n# Your privacy controls\\\\n\\\\n## You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\\\\n\\\\nGo to Privacy Checkup\\\\n\\\\n## Managing, reviewing, and updating your information\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.\\\\n\\\\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:\\\\n\\\\n### Privacy controls\\\\n\\\\n### Activity Controls\\\\n\\\\nDecide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Activity Controls\\\\n\\\\n### Ad settings\\\\n\\\\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. You can modify your interests, choose whether your personal information is used to make ads more relevant to you, and turn on or off certain advertising services.\\\\n\\\\n### About you\\\\n\\\\nManage personal info in your Google Account and control who can see it across Google services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to About You\\\\n\\\\n### Shared endorsements\\\\n\\\\nChoose whether your name and photo appear next to your activity, like reviews and recommendations, that appear in ads.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Shared Endorsements\\\\n\\\\n### Sites and apps that use Google services\\\\n\\\\nManage information that websites and apps using Google services, like Google Analytics, may share with Google when you visit or interact with their services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services\\\\n\\\\n### Ways to review & update your information\\\\n\\\\n### My Activity\\\\n\\\\nMy Activity allows you to review and control data that’s saved to your Google Account when you’re signed in and using Google services, like searches you’ve done or your visits to Google Play. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.\\\\n\\\\nGo to My Activity\\\\n\\\\n### Google Dashboard\\\\n\\\\nGoogle Dashboard allows you to manage information associated with specific products.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Dashboard\\\\n\\\\n### Your personal information\\\\n\\\\nManage your contact information, such as your name, email, and phone number.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Personal Info\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed out, you can manage information associated with your browser or device, including:\\\\n\\\\n- Signed-out search personalization: Choose whether your search activity is used to offer you more relevant results and recommendations.\\\\n\\\\n- YouTube settings: Pause and delete your YouTube Search History and your YouTube Watch History.\\\\n\\\\n- Ad Settings: Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.\\\\n\\\\n## Exporting, removing & deleting your information\\\\n\\\\nYou can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.\\\\n\\\\nExport your data\\\\n\\\\nTo delete your information, you can:\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your content from specific Google services\\\\n\\\\n- Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\\\\n\\\\n- Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your entire Google Account\\\\n\\\\nDelete your information\\\\n\\\\nInactive Account Manager allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account.\\\\n\\\\nAnd finally, you can also request to remove content from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.\\\\n\\\\nThere are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:\\\\n\\\\n- Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a cookie in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.\\\\n\\\\n- Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\\\\n\\\\n# Sharing your information\\\\n\\\\n## When you share your information\\\\n\\\\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.\\\\n\\\\n## When Google shares your information\\\\n\\\\nWe do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:\\\\n\\\\n### With your consent\\\\n\\\\nWe’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.\\\\n\\\\n### With domain administrators\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:\\\\n\\\\n- Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email\\\\n\\\\n- View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install\\\\n\\\\n- Change your account password\\\\n\\\\n- Suspend or terminate your account access\\\\n\\\\n- Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request\\\\n\\\\n- Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings\\\\n\\\\n### For external processing\\\\n\\\\n### For legal reasons\\\\n\\\\nWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\\\\n\\\\n- Respond to any applicable law, regulation,legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.\\\\n\\\\n- Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.\\\\n\\\\n- Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public.\\\\n\\\\nWe may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.\\\\n\\\\n# Keeping your information secure\\\\n\\\\n## We build security into our services to protect your information\\\\n\\\\nAll Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.\\\\n\\\\nWe work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:\\\\n\\\\n- We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit\\\\n\\\\n- We offer a range of security features, like Safe Browsing, Security Checkup, and 2 Step Verification to help you protect your account\\\\n\\\\n- We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems\\\\n\\\\n- We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.\\\\n\\\\n# Exporting & deleting your information\\\\n\\\\nYou can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your content from specific Google services\\\\n\\\\n- Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\\\\n\\\\n- Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your entire Google Account\\\\n\\\\n# Retaining your information\\\\n\\\\nWe retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:\\\\n\\\\n- Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your personal info or the content you create or upload, like photos and documents. You can also delete activity information saved in your account, or choose to have it deleted automatically after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.\\\\n\\\\n- Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as advertising data in server logs.\\\\n\\\\n- We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.\\\\n\\\\n- And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.\\\\n\\\\n# Compliance & cooperation with regulators\\\\n\\\\n## Data transfers\\\\n\\\\nWe maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data.\\\\n\\\\nWhen we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.\\\\n\\\\n## U.S. state law requirements\\\\n\\\\nSome U.S. state privacy laws require specific disclosures.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain the categories of information Google collects and the sources of that information in Information Google collects.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain the purposes for which Google collects and uses information in Why Google collects data.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain when Google may disclose information in Sharing your information. Google does not sell your personal information. Google also does not “share” your personal information as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\\\\n\\\\n- We explain how Google retains information in Retaining your information. You can also learn more about how Google anonymizes data. As described there, when Google anonymizes data to protect your privacy, we maintain policies and technical measures to avoid re-identifying that information.\\\\n\\\\nU.S. state privacy laws also provide the right to request information about how Google collects, uses, and discloses your information. And they give you the right to access your information, sometimes in a portable format; correct your information; and to request that Google delete that information. Many of these laws also provide the right to opt out of certain forms of profiling and targeted advertising.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy.

The first time you turn on Location History — which is off by default — your auto-delete option will be set to 18 months by default. Web & App Activity auto-delete will also default to 18 months for new accounts.

DO NOT EDIT. ======================================================\\\\n\\\\nthis file is generated from src/style.less\\\\n\\\\nOpinionThe Privacy Project Google’s 4,000-Word Privacy Policy Is a Secret History of the Internet By Charlie Warzel and Ash Ngu Illustrated by Rose Wong\\\\n\\\\nThe late 1990s was a simpler time for Google. The nascent company was merely a search engine, and Gmail, Android and YouTube were but glimmers in the startup’s eye. Google’s first privacy policy reflected that simplicity. It was short and earnest, a quaint artifact of a different time in Silicon Valley, when Google offered 600 words to explain how it was collecting and using personal information.\\\\n\\\\nThat version of the internet (and Google) is gone. Over the past 20 years, that same privacy policy has been rewritten into a sprawling 4,000-word explanation of the company’s data practices.\\\\n\\\\nThis evolution, across two decades and 30 versions, is the story of the internet’s transformation through the eyes of one of its most crucial entities. The web is now terribly complex, and Google has a privacy policy to match.\\\\n\\\\nGoogle’s Privacy Policy Over Time 1999 Google is sensitive to the privacy concerns of its users. The Internet allows individuals to explore and communicate with unprecedented ease, but it also allows websites to collect and distribute personal information with equal ease. We at Google know that many users are, understandably, concerned about such practices, and we wish to make clear our policy for collecting and using personal information. Google’s Policy Google’s policy on our wholly controlled and operated Internet sites is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. Google does not willfully disclose individually identifiable information about its customers to any third party without first receiving that customer’s permission. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it. Google may share information about users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we only talk about our users in aggregate, not as individuals. For example, we may disclose how frequently the average Google user visits Google, or which other query words are most often used with the query word “Microsoft.” From time to time, there may be situations where Google asks you for personal information. When we intend to use your personal information, we tell you up front. This way you can decide whether you want to give us the information or not. In case you change your mind or some personal information changes, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us. Google and Cookies Upon your first visit to Google, Google sends a “cookie” to your computer. A cookie is a file that identifies you as a unique user. It can also store personal preferences and user data. A cookie can tell us, “This is the same individual who visited Google two days ago” but it cannot tell us, “This person is Joe Smith” or even, “This person lives in the United States.” Google uses cookies to track user trends and patterns, in order to better understand our user base and to improve the quality of our service. Google may also choose to use cookies to store user preferences. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of Google may not function properly if you refuse cookies. Links to Other Sites The page that comes up after “clicking” on a result URL is likely to be outside the Google site and beyond our control. Other links, such as for the Google-friends mailing list archive, are also on sites not controlled by Google. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Google may choose to exhibit its search results in the form of a “URL redirecter.” When a URL redirecter is used, whenever you “click” on a URL from a search result, information about the “click” is sent to Google, which then sends you to the site you clicked on. Google uses this URL information to understand and improve the quality of Google’s search technology. For instance, Google uses this information to determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results. Google’s policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Google’s control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. We reserve the right at our discretion to make changes to this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. 2009 At Google we recognize that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by Google Inc. or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies except DoubleClick (DoubleClick Privacy Policy) and Postini (Postini Privacy Policy); collectively, Google’s “services.” In addition, where more detailed information is needed to explain our privacy practices, we post supplementary privacy notices to describe how particular services process personal information. These notices can be found in the Google Privacy Center. Google adheres to the US Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement, and is registered with the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor Program. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us through our website or write to us at Privacy Matters c/o Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, California, 94043 USA Information we collect and how we use it We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information to us, such as Google Search. In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information: Information you provide – When you sign up for a Google Account or other Google service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password). For certain services, such as our advertising programs, we also request credit card or other payment account information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers. We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other Google services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information. Cookies – When you visit Google, we send one or more cookies – a small file containing a string of characters – to your computer or other device that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, improving search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends, such as how people search. Google also uses cookies in its advertising services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. We may set one or more cookies in your browser when you visit a website, including Google sites that use our advertising cookies, and view or click on an ad supported by Google’s advertising services. Log information – When you access Google services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. User communications – When you send email or other communications to Google, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. Affiliated Google Services on other sites – We offer some of our services on or through other web sites. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to Google in order to deliver the service. We process such information under this Privacy Policy. The affiliated sites through which our services are offered may have different privacy practices and we encourage you to read their privacy policies. Gadgets – Google may make available third party applications through its services. The information collected by Google when you enable a gadget or other application is processed under this Privacy Policy. Information collected by the application or gadget provider is governed by their privacy policies. Location data – Google offers location-enabled services, such as Google Maps for mobile. If you use those services, Google may receive information about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate a location (such as a cell ID). Links – Google may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality of our search technology, customized content and advertising. Read more information about links and redirected URLs. Other sites – This Privacy Policy applies to Google services only. We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as search results, sites that include Google applications, products or services, or links from within our various services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Google only processes personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and/or the supplementary privacy notices for specific services. In addition to the above, such purposes include: Providing our services, including the display of customized content and advertising; Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services; Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; Protecting the rights or property of Google or our users; and Developing new services. You can find more information about how we process personal information by referring to the supplementary privacy notices for particular services. Google processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country. We may process personal information to provide our own services. In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising partners. Choices for personal information When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service privacy notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the supplementary service privacy notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Google features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. Google uses the DoubleClick advertising cookie on AdSense partner sites and certain Google services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web.

Information sharing Google only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Google in the following limited circumstances: We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information. We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, its users or the public as required or permitted by law. If Google becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually. Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data. Information security We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. Data integrity Google processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services or as otherwise permitted under this Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary. Accessing and updating personal information When you use Google services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users’ personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services. Enforcement Google regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or Google’s treatment of personal information by contacting us through this web site or by writing to us at Privacy Matters c/o Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, California, 94043 USA When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is Google’s policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Google and an individual. Changes to this Privacy Policy Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor.

Effective January 22, 2019 | Archived versions | Download PDF We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include: Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads and embedded Google Maps You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used. To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us. INFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls. When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions. When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information. Things you create or provide to us When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services. We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.

The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request. We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and which apps you've installed. Your activity We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like.

You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account. Go to Google Account Your location information We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions for your weekend getaway or showtimes for movies playing near you. Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by: GPS IP address Sensor data from your device Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Google’s Policy Google’s policy on our wholly controlled and operated Internet sites is to respect and protect the privacy of our users.

These include:\\\\n\\\\n- GPS and other sensor data from your device\\\\n\\\\n- IP address\\\\n\\\\n- Activity on Google services, such as from your searches or places you label like home or work\\\\n\\\\n- Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices\\\\n\\\\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings.

For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\\\\n\\\\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\\\\n\\\\n# Why Google collects data\\\\n\\\\n## We use data to build better services\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\\\\n\\\\n### Provide our services\\\\n\\\\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\\\\n\\\\n### Maintain & improve our services\\\\n\\\\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\\\\n\\\\n### Develop new services\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\\\\n\\\\n### Provide personalized services, including content and ads\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\\\\n\\\\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\\\\n\\\\nGo to My Ad Center\\\\n\\\\n### Measure performance\\\\n\\\\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\\\\n\\\\n### Communicate with you\\\\n\\\\n### Protect Google, our users, and the public\\\\n\\\\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\\\\n\\\\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\\\\n\\\\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.\\\\n\\\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\\\\n\\\\n# Your privacy controls\\\\n\\\\n## You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\\\\n\\\\nGo to Privacy Checkup\\\\n\\\\n## Managing, reviewing, and updating your information\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.\\\\n\\\\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:\\\\n\\\\n### Privacy controls\\\\n\\\\n### Activity Controls\\\\n\\\\nDecide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Activity Controls\\\\n\\\\n### Ad settings\\\\n\\\\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. You can modify your interests, choose whether your personal information is used to make ads more relevant to you, and turn on or off certain advertising services.\\\\n\\\\n### About you\\\\n\\\\nManage personal info in your Google Account and control who can see it across Google services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to About You\\\\n\\\\n### Shared endorsements\\\\n\\\\nChoose whether your name and photo appear next to your activity, like reviews and recommendations, that appear in ads.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Shared Endorsements\\\\n\\\\n### Sites and apps that use Google services\\\\n\\\\nManage information that websites and apps using Google services, like Google Analytics, may share with Google when you visit or interact with their services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services\\\\n\\\\n### Ways to review & update your information\\\\n\\\\n### My Activity\\\\n\\\\nMy Activity allows you to review and control data that’s saved to your Google Account when you’re signed in and using Google services, like searches you’ve done or your visits to Google Play.

You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.\\\\n\\\\n- Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\\\\n\\\\n# Sharing your information\\\\n\\\\n## When you share your information\\\\n\\\\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.\\\\n\\\\n## When Google shares your information\\\\n\\\\nWe do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:\\\\n\\\\n### With your consent\\\\n\\\\nWe’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.\\\\n\\\\n### With domain administrators\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:\\\\n\\\\n- Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email\\\\n\\\\n- View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install\\\\n\\\\n- Change your account password\\\\n\\\\n- Suspend or terminate your account access\\\\n\\\\n- Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request\\\\n\\\\n- Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings\\\\n\\\\n### For external processing\\\\n\\\\n### For legal reasons\\\\n\\\\nWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\\\\n\\\\n- Respond to any applicable law, regulation,legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.\\\\n\\\\n- Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.\\\\n\\\\n- Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public.\\\\n\\\\nWe may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.\\\\n\\\\n# Keeping your information secure\\\\n\\\\n## We build security into our services to protect your information\\\\n\\\\nAll Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you.
