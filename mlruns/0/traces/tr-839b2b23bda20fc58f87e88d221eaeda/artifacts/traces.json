It also identifies where you can go to get more information and to find tools and controls for managing your data. This is not meant to replace our Data Policy, and we don't address everything here. Read the full\\nData Policy\\nUnderstanding Data: What Information Do We Collect\\nWe collect information about you and your activity, on and off Facebook and Instagram. There's lots of information in our Data Policy about the kinds of information we collect, with some examples and links to where you can learn more. But here are some of the categories of things we receive: the content you provide when you post, like or comment, your connections, your transactions, and your usage of our products. We also collect information that other people provide about you, like when they tag you in a photo. We also collect information from your device, such as identifiers, cookies, and information you can control using your device settings, including your camera, microphone and different kinds of location information, along with information from our partners, like websites you visit, apps you use or purchases you make.\\nSharing Your Data\\nData allows us to provide a personalized experience to different people, and to learn new things and improve our service. There's lots of information in our Data Policy about the ways we use the information we have, with some examples and links to where you can learn more. But here are some of the ways we use data:\\nPeople and accounts on Instagram, depending on the audience you choose, your settings, and the features you use. Remember that public information can be seen by anyone.\\nServices (like apps and websites) you choose to give access to your Instagram information, like if you use a service to see all your social media together. You can revoke their access to your information,\\nhere.\\nAdvertisers. We help advertisers understand whether their ads are effective. We also share with companies that help to make reports for advertisers.\\nCompanies that offer things through Instagram, like if you buy something and provide your shipping address.\\nVendors and service providers we hire to help us with our business.\\nResearchers and academics, like to try to understand how to stop bullying and harassment online.\\nLegal requests (like from a court or law enforcement), when consistent with the law and our policies.\\nHow To Access and Download Your Data\\nA great first step to controlling your online data is to understand what you’ve shared. We offer tools to review the information we have for your account and the data you’ve shared on Instagram. You’ll see information we have about you, as well as your content, like your posts, comments, and messages. Learn how to use these tools in our\\nHelp Center.\\nHow to Delete Your Data\\nSometimes people change their minds about things they’ve shared online. To delete a photo or video that you've posted, tap above your post and then tap Delete. You can also\\narchive posts\\nto hide them from your profile and make it so your followers and other people on Instagram can't see it. But don’t worry—when you archive a post, it keeps all its likes and comments.\\nYou can also temporarily disable or delete your account at any time. When you delete your account, we delete your posts, and you won't be able to recover that information later.\\nLearn more.\\nAnything that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted if you delete your account. But, if you are concerned about a picture or information someone else has posted about you, you can report it to us.

And we’ve paired it with the Privacy Center and new controls to manage your experience, like who sees your posts and the topics you want to see ads about.\\nStarting today, Meta is rolling out notifications letting people know that we’ve updated our\\nPrivacy Policy\\n, formerly known as the Data Policy. Inspired by feedback from people who use our technologies and privacy experts, we rewrote our Privacy Policy to make it easier to understand and to reflect the latest products we offer. While the text looks different in many places,\\nMeta is not collecting, using or sharing your data in new ways based on this policy update and\\nwe still do not sell your information.\\nOur goal with this update is to be more clear about our data practices; one way we’ve done this is through additional details and examples throughout. At Meta, we’ve always set out to build personalized experiences that provide value without compromising your privacy. So, it’s on us to have strong protections for the data we use and be transparent about how we use it. That includes\\ncommunicating more clearly\\nabout our data practices and the choices you have.\\nWe’re also including more ways to access controls you can use to experience our products in ways that are right for you. You can continue to manage your privacy settings at any time and\\nwe’re committed to letting you know if we make important changes to how we collect, use and share your information.\\nIn addition, we’re updating our\\nTerms of Service\\nto\\nbetter explain what is expected from us and those who use our platforms. These expectations include the rights and obligations described in our Community Standards, for example when we may disable or terminate accounts that violate our Terms or Community Standards or others’ intellectual property rights or other laws. Some Terms of Service changes match updates to our Privacy Policy, including additional details about what happens when you delete content.\\nNotifications that people will start to receive today on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger will direct them to information about what to expect from the relevant Privacy Policy and Terms of Service in their region. They’ll also see a summary of what’s different. These updates go into effect on July 26, and people don’t need to act on this notification by this date to continue using our products.\\nThe updated Meta Privacy Policy covers Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and\\nother Meta products\\n. It doesn’t cover WhatsApp, Workplace, Free Basics, Messenger Kids or the use of Quest devices without a Facebook account, which have their own privacy policies.\\nResponding To Feedback and Evolving Regulation\\nAs privacy and data protection regulations have improved around the world in recent years, we’ve\\nexplored\\nideas in people-centered privacy design and have worked to make our data practices more transparent. The updates we’re announcing today are inspired by feedback from privacy experts, policymakers, and people who use our services. Our aim going forward is to update our Privacy Policy more frequently as we continue to learn what areas we can improve.\\nWe encourage everyone to read our updated Policy which will help people understand how our practices apply, including up to date information about our newer products, like Shops and Facebook View, as we continue to innovate. We’ve added more examples about the kinds of information we collect to provide the personalized services people expect, like recommended content and suggested connections. We’ve also included more details about the types of third-parties with whom we share and receive information and explained how and why people’s information is shared across our products, among other changes. Our updated policy has more details about information we collect if you use our products but don’t have an account and when we share information with law enforcement for the purposes of safety and security. For a summary of other key changes to our Privacy Policy, you can review\\nthis page\\n.\\nPrivacy Center\\nEarlier this year, we began to roll out\\nPrivacy Center\\nas a place where people can learn more about Meta’s approach to privacy across our apps and technologies. Privacy Center is now available to everyone who uses Facebook on desktop and mobile and connects directly to our updated Privacy Policy.\\nYou can think of Privacy Center as a hub for your privacy questions, where you can learn about how we use data, make use of some of the various privacy controls that we offer, and brush up on key account security tips and tools. We’ll also continue adding more guides and controls to it.\\nUpdating\\nControls for Your Privacy\\nNew Audience Controls:\\nStarting today, we’re also rolling out a new setting to make it easier to manage who sees your posts on Facebook. Now, when someone selects a default audience, that audience selection will apply to new posts created in Facebook that they share to their timeline unless they select a different audience for a particular post. Previously, your default audience for posts matched whichever audience you chose most recently. So if you had just made a post that was available to the public, your subsequent posts would be as well. This\\nnew setting\\nwill help make sure you’re sharing with the right people in your community.\\nNew Ways to Manage the Ads You See:\\nRecently\\n, we consolidated the Ad Topics and Interest Categories controls into a single control that can be accessed on Facebook and Instagram, covering a more extensive set of ad topics.\\nThis allows people\\nto use a single control to set preferences across ad topics that reflect the interest targeting categories advertisers may use to reach them and the content they might see in an ad.\\nDownloads\\n5 things to know about Meta's Privacy Policy update\\nCategories\\n:\\nData and Privacy\\nMeta\\nPublic Policy\\nTags:\\nPrivacy Matters\\nDOWNLOAD ALL IMAGES\\nShare this article\\nRecent News\\nExpanding Our Data Center Community Action Grants Program\\nFacebook Marketplace Gets a Glow Up\\nMeta’s 30th Data Center: Delivering AI, Creating Community Benefits, and Supporting Wetlands Restoration\\nHow Meta’s Data Centers Drive Economic Growth Across the US\\nRelated News\\nMeta\\nReflecting on Meta’s $8 Billion Investment in Privacy\\nJanuary 28, 2025\\nJuly 9, 2025\\nMeta\\nPrivacy Conversations: Risk Management and AI With Susan Cooper and Bojana Belamy\\nAugust 14, 2025\\nAugust 14, 2025\\nFollow Meta Newsroom\\nPress Resources\\npress@meta.com\\nMedia Gallery\\nFacebook\\nMeta Store\\nRay-Ban Meta glasses\\nOakley Meta glasses\\nMeta Quest\\nAccessories\\nApps and games\\nMeta Quest gift cards\\nRefurbished Meta Quest 3\\nRefurbished Meta Quest 3S\\nRefurbished Ray-Ban Meta glasses\\nMore from Ray-Ban\\nMeta Quest: Play now.

Your online safety shouldnât stop with Google â it should extend to the whole internet. Thatâs why we continue to innovate privacy technologies and make them widely available. We share our learnings, experiences, and tools with partners, organizations, and competitors, because keeping the internet safe requires everyone to work together.\\nKeeping the internet open, private, and safe is at the core of everything we do.

Web & App Activity auto-delete will also default to 18 months for new accounts. This means your activity data will be automatically and continuously deleted after 18 months, rather than kept until you choose to delete it. You can always turn these settings off or change your auto-delete setting at any time.\\nLearn more\\nPlay video\\nPause video\\nBlocking access\\nWe never sell your personal information, and give you controls over who has access\\nWe are committed to protecting your data from third parties. Thatâs why itâs our strict policy to never sell your personal information to anyone. We donât share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the Tap to Call button, weâll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop. If youâre using an Android device, we require third-party apps to ask for your permission to access certain types of data â like your photos, contacts, or location.\\nView our Privacy Policy\\nPlay video\\nPause video\\nData transparency\\nMaking it easy to view and delete your data\\nHow you use our products and services is a personal choice thatâs up to you. To help you make informed decisions about what data to save, share, or delete, we make it easy to understand what data is being collected and why.\\nFor example, with Dashboard, you can see an overview of the Google products you use and the things you store, like your emails and photos. And with My Activity, itâs easy to see or delete data collected from your activity across Google services, including things youâve searched, viewed, and watched.\\nGo to your Google Account\\nPlay video\\nPause video\\nData portability\\nEmpowering you to take your data with you\\nEvery user should have access to the content theyâve shared with us â anytime and for any reason.

Each product and feature adheres to these privacy standards, which are implemented through comprehensive privacy reviews.\\nLearn more in our Privacy Policy\\nLeading the way in\\nresponsible innovation\\nAs new threats arise and user needs evolve, we are continuously innovating to automatically protect the private information of every user, at every risk level, across all our products.\\nAnonymization\\nStrengthening privacy protections through anonymization\\nWe use leading anonymization techniques, like differential privacy, to gain insights from data without compromising the anonymity of our users. This allows us to create services that are more helpful. For example, in Google Maps you can see how busy a place will be before you go there, based on millions of anonymized data points.\\nLearn more\\nFederated Learning\\nBuilding helpful products with less data\\nFederated learning is a data-minimization technology pioneered at Google that brings machine learning (ML) intelligence right to your device. This new approach combines anonymized information from different devices to train ML models. Federated learning helps preserve your privacy by keeping as much personal information on your device as possible.\\nLearn more\\nOpen-Source Privacy Technologies\\nSharing our privacy protections and innovations\\nWe are committed to constantly improving the privacy protections we offer and sharing these advancements with others. Thatâs why we open-source our advanced anonymization and data minimization technologies, like differential privacy, federated learning, and Private Join and Compute. Itâs our hope that these open-source tools help produce insights that benefit everyone while still protecting individual privacy.\\n1\\n/\\nWe are committed to complying with applicable data-protection laws\\nWe are always working to stay compliant with applicable privacy regulations. Over the years, we have worked closely with data-protection authorities around the world and have implemented strong privacy protections that reflect their guidance.

But here are some of the ways we use data:\\nPeople and accounts on Instagram, depending on the audience you choose, your settings, and the features you use. Remember that public information can be seen by anyone.\\nServices (like apps and websites) you choose to give access to your Instagram information, like if you use a service to see all your social media together. You can revoke their access to your information,\\nhere.\\nAdvertisers. We help advertisers understand whether their ads are effective. We also share with companies that help to make reports for advertisers.\\nCompanies that offer things through Instagram, like if you buy something and provide your shipping address.\\nVendors and service providers we hire to help us with our business.\\nResearchers and academics, like to try to understand how to stop bullying and harassment online.\\nLegal requests (like from a court or law enforcement), when consistent with the law and our policies.\\nHow To Access and Download Your Data\\nA great first step to controlling your online data is to understand what you’ve shared. We offer tools to review the information we have for your account and the data you’ve shared on Instagram. You’ll see information we have about you, as well as your content, like your posts, comments, and messages. Learn how to use these tools in our\\nHelp Center.\\nHow to Delete Your Data\\nSometimes people change their minds about things they’ve shared online. To delete a photo or video that you've posted, tap above your post and then tap Delete. You can also\\narchive posts\\nto hide them from your profile and make it so your followers and other people on Instagram can't see it. But don’t worry—when you archive a post, it keeps all its likes and comments.\\nYou can also temporarily disable or delete your account at any time. When you delete your account, we delete your posts, and you won't be able to recover that information later.\\nLearn more.\\nAnything that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted if you delete your account. But, if you are concerned about a picture or information someone else has posted about you, you can report it to us. See how “To report a post,” above.\\nRELATED ARTICLES\\nCheck out more announcements about Instagram\\n#ANNOUNCEMENTS\\nEdit and Restyle Instagram Stories Using Meta AI\\n#ANNOUNCEMENTS\\nInstagram Teen Accounts Will Be Guided by PG-13 Ratings\\n#ANNOUNCEMENTS\\nProtecting Teens & Schools: Instagram’s New Safety Programs\\nOur Story\\nLeadership\\nBrand\\nBrand Kit\\nWorking at Instagram\\nPolitics\\nFeatures\\nReels\\nStories\\nDMs\\nSearch & Explore\\nSafety\\nSafety Tools\\nPrivacy Tools\\nAccount Security\\nCommunity\\nSchool Partnerships\\nTeen Accounts\\nAnti-Bullying\\nParents\\nPrograms\\nThreads\\nEdits\\nBusiness\\nCreators\\nNews\\nMeta\\nFamily Center\\nHelp Center\\n/>\\n/>\\nOur Story\\nFeatures\\nSafety\\nNews\\nMeta\\n/>\\n/>\\nEnglish (US)\\nEnglish (US)\\nSelect your preference.\\nLanguages\\nEnglish (US)\\nEspañol\\nFrançais (France)\\nPortuguês (Brasil)\\n한국어\\nDeutsch\\n日本語\\nहिन्दी\\nItaliano\\nInstagram from Meta\\nAPI\\nPrivacy\\nTerms\\nSitemap\\nAPI\\nPrivacy\\nTerms\\nSitemap\\n\\nRespond ONLY with valid JSON.

And we’ve paired it with the Privacy Center and new controls to manage your experience, like who sees your posts and the topics you want to see ads about.\\nStarting today, Meta is rolling out notifications letting people know that we’ve updated our\\nPrivacy Policy\\n, formerly known as the Data Policy. Inspired by feedback from people who use our technologies and privacy experts, we rewrote our Privacy Policy to make it easier to understand and to reflect the latest products we offer. While the text looks different in many places,\\nMeta is not collecting, using or sharing your data in new ways based on this policy update and\\nwe still do not sell your information.\\nOur goal with this update is to be more clear about our data practices; one way we’ve done this is through additional details and examples throughout. At Meta, we’ve always set out to build personalized experiences that provide value without compromising your privacy. So, it’s on us to have strong protections for the data we use and be transparent about how we use it. That includes\\ncommunicating more clearly\\nabout our data practices and the choices you have.\\nWe’re also including more ways to access controls you can use to experience our products in ways that are right for you. You can continue to manage your privacy settings at any time and\\nwe’re committed to letting you know if we make important changes to how we collect, use and share your information.\\nIn addition, we’re updating our\\nTerms of Service\\nto\\nbetter explain what is expected from us and those who use our platforms. These expectations include the rights and obligations described in our Community Standards, for example when we may disable or terminate accounts that violate our Terms or Community Standards or others’ intellectual property rights or other laws. Some Terms of Service changes match updates to our Privacy Policy, including additional details about what happens when you delete content.\\nNotifications that people will start to receive today on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger will direct them to information about what to expect from the relevant Privacy Policy and Terms of Service in their region. They’ll also see a summary of what’s different. These updates go into effect on July 26, and people don’t need to act on this notification by this date to continue using our products.\\nThe updated Meta Privacy Policy covers Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and\\nother Meta products\\n. It doesn’t cover WhatsApp, Workplace, Free Basics, Messenger Kids or the use of Quest devices without a Facebook account, which have their own privacy policies.\\nResponding To Feedback and Evolving Regulation\\nAs privacy and data protection regulations have improved around the world in recent years, we’ve\\nexplored\\nideas in people-centered privacy design and have worked to make our data practices more transparent. The updates we’re announcing today are inspired by feedback from privacy experts, policymakers, and people who use our services. Our aim going forward is to update our Privacy Policy more frequently as we continue to learn what areas we can improve.\\nWe encourage everyone to read our updated Policy which will help people understand how our practices apply, including up to date information about our newer products, like Shops and Facebook View, as we continue to innovate. We’ve added more examples about the kinds of information we collect to provide the personalized services people expect, like recommended content and suggested connections. We’ve also included more details about the types of third-parties with whom we share and receive information and explained how and why people’s information is shared across our products, among other changes. Our updated policy has more details about information we collect if you use our products but don’t have an account and when we share information with law enforcement for the purposes of safety and security. For a summary of other key changes to our Privacy Policy, you can review\\nthis page\\n.\\nPrivacy Center\\nEarlier this year, we began to roll out\\nPrivacy Center\\nas a place where people can learn more about Meta’s approach to privacy across our apps and technologies. Privacy Center is now available to everyone who uses Facebook on desktop and mobile and connects directly to our updated Privacy Policy.\\nYou can think of Privacy Center as a hub for your privacy questions, where you can learn about how we use data, make use of some of the various privacy controls that we offer, and brush up on key account security tips and tools. We’ll also continue adding more guides and controls to it.\\nUpdating\\nControls for Your Privacy\\nNew Audience Controls:\\nStarting today, we’re also rolling out a new setting to make it easier to manage who sees your posts on Facebook. Now, when someone selects a default audience, that audience selection will apply to new posts created in Facebook that they share to their timeline unless they select a different audience for a particular post. Previously, your default audience for posts matched whichever audience you chose most recently. So if you had just made a post that was available to the public, your subsequent posts would be as well. This\\nnew setting\\nwill help make sure you’re sharing with the right people in your community.\\nNew Ways to Manage the Ads You See:\\nRecently\\n, we consolidated the Ad Topics and Interest Categories controls into a single control that can be accessed on Facebook and Instagram, covering a more extensive set of ad topics.\\nThis allows people\\nto use a single control to set preferences across ad topics that reflect the interest targeting categories advertisers may use to reach them and the content they might see in an ad.\\nDownloads\\n5 things to know about Meta's Privacy Policy update\\nCategories\\n:\\nData and Privacy\\nMeta\\nPublic Policy\\nTags:\\nPrivacy Matters\\nDOWNLOAD ALL IMAGES\\nShare this article\\nRecent News\\nExpanding Our Data Center Community Action Grants Program\\nFacebook Marketplace Gets a Glow Up\\nMeta’s 30th Data Center: Delivering AI, Creating Community Benefits, and Supporting Wetlands Restoration\\nHow Meta’s Data Centers Drive Economic Growth Across the US\\nRelated News\\nMeta\\nReflecting on Meta’s $8 Billion Investment in Privacy\\nJanuary 28, 2025\\nJuly 9, 2025\\nMeta\\nPrivacy Conversations: Risk Management and AI With Susan Cooper and Bojana Belamy\\nAugust 14, 2025\\nAugust 14, 2025\\nFollow Meta Newsroom\\nPress Resources\\npress@meta.com\\nMedia Gallery\\nFacebook\\nMeta Store\\nRay-Ban Meta glasses\\nOakley Meta glasses\\nMeta Quest\\nAccessories\\nApps and games\\nMeta Quest gift cards\\nRefurbished Meta Quest 3\\nRefurbished Meta Quest 3S\\nRefurbished Ray-Ban Meta glasses\\nMore from Ray-Ban\\nMeta Quest: Play now.

This allows us to create services that are more helpful. For example, in Google Maps you can see how busy a place will be before you go there, based on millions of anonymized data points.\\nLearn more\\nFederated Learning\\nBuilding helpful products with less data\\nFederated learning is a data-minimization technology pioneered at Google that brings machine learning (ML) intelligence right to your device. This new approach combines anonymized information from different devices to train ML models. Federated learning helps preserve your privacy by keeping as much personal information on your device as possible.\\nLearn more\\nOpen-Source Privacy Technologies\\nSharing our privacy protections and innovations\\nWe are committed to constantly improving the privacy protections we offer and sharing these advancements with others. Thatâs why we open-source our advanced anonymization and data minimization technologies, like differential privacy, federated learning, and Private Join and Compute. Itâs our hope that these open-source tools help produce insights that benefit everyone while still protecting individual privacy.\\n1\\n/\\nWe are committed to complying with applicable data-protection laws\\nWe are always working to stay compliant with applicable privacy regulations. Over the years, we have worked closely with data-protection authorities around the world and have implemented strong privacy protections that reflect their guidance.

But here are some of the categories of things we receive: the content you provide when you post, like or comment, your connections, your transactions, and your usage of our products. We also collect information that other people provide about you, like when they tag you in a photo. We also collect information from your device, such as identifiers, cookies, and information you can control using your device settings, including your camera, microphone and different kinds of location information, along with information from our partners, like websites you visit, apps you use or purchases you make.\\nSharing Your Data\\nData allows us to provide a personalized experience to different people, and to learn new things and improve our service. There's lots of information in our Data Policy about the ways we use the information we have, with some examples and links to where you can learn more. But here are some of the ways we use data:\\nPeople and accounts on Instagram, depending on the audience you choose, your settings, and the features you use. Remember that public information can be seen by anyone.\\nServices (like apps and websites) you choose to give access to your Instagram information, like if you use a service to see all your social media together. You can revoke their access to your information,\\nhere.\\nAdvertisers. We help advertisers understand whether their ads are effective. We also share with companies that help to make reports for advertisers.\\nCompanies that offer things through Instagram, like if you buy something and provide your shipping address.\\nVendors and service providers we hire to help us with our business.\\nResearchers and academics, like to try to understand how to stop bullying and harassment online.\\nLegal requests (like from a court or law enforcement), when consistent with the law and our policies.\\nHow To Access and Download Your Data\\nA great first step to controlling your online data is to understand what you’ve shared. We offer tools to review the information we have for your account and the data you’ve shared on Instagram. You’ll see information we have about you, as well as your content, like your posts, comments, and messages. Learn how to use these tools in our\\nHelp Center.\\nHow to Delete Your Data\\nSometimes people change their minds about things they’ve shared online. To delete a photo or video that you've posted, tap above your post and then tap Delete. You can also\\narchive posts\\nto hide them from your profile and make it so your followers and other people on Instagram can't see it. But don’t worry—when you archive a post, it keeps all its likes and comments.\\nYou can also temporarily disable or delete your account at any time. When you delete your account, we delete your posts, and you won't be able to recover that information later.\\nLearn more.\\nAnything that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted if you delete your account. But, if you are concerned about a picture or information someone else has posted about you, you can report it to us. See how “To report a post,” above.\\nRELATED ARTICLES\\nCheck out more announcements about Instagram\\n#ANNOUNCEMENTS\\nEdit and Restyle Instagram Stories Using Meta AI\\n#ANNOUNCEMENTS\\nInstagram Teen Accounts Will Be Guided by PG-13 Ratings\\n#ANNOUNCEMENTS\\nProtecting Teens & Schools: Instagram’s New Safety Programs\\nOur Story\\nLeadership\\nBrand\\nBrand Kit\\nWorking at Instagram\\nPolitics\\nFeatures\\nReels\\nStories\\nDMs\\nSearch & Explore\\nSafety\\nSafety Tools\\nPrivacy Tools\\nAccount Security\\nCommunity\\nSchool Partnerships\\nTeen Accounts\\nAnti-Bullying\\nParents\\nPrograms\\nThreads\\nEdits\\nBusiness\\nCreators\\nNews\\nMeta\\nFamily Center\\nHelp Center\\n/>\\n/>\\nOur Story\\nFeatures\\nSafety\\nNews\\nMeta\\n/>\\n/>\\nEnglish (US)\\nEnglish (US)\\nSelect your preference.\\nLanguages\\nEnglish (US)\\nEspañol\\nFrançais (France)\\nPortuguês (Brasil)\\n한국어\\nDeutsch\\n日本語\\nहिन्दी\\nItaliano\\nInstagram from Meta\\nAPI\\nPrivacy\\nTerms\\nSitemap\\nAPI\\nPrivacy\\nTerms\\nSitemap\\n\\nRespond ONLY with valid JSON.

And we’ve paired it with the Privacy Center and new controls to manage your experience, like who sees your posts and the topics you want to see ads about.\\nStarting today, Meta is rolling out notifications letting people know that we’ve updated our\\nPrivacy Policy\\n, formerly known as the Data Policy. Inspired by feedback from people who use our technologies and privacy experts, we rewrote our Privacy Policy to make it easier to understand and to reflect the latest products we offer. While the text looks different in many places,\\nMeta is not collecting, using or sharing your data in new ways based on this policy update and\\nwe still do not sell your information.\\nOur goal with this update is to be more clear about our data practices; one way we’ve done this is through additional details and examples throughout. At Meta, we’ve always set out to build personalized experiences that provide value without compromising your privacy. So, it’s on us to have strong protections for the data we use and be transparent about how we use it. That includes\\ncommunicating more clearly\\nabout our data practices and the choices you have.\\nWe’re also including more ways to access controls you can use to experience our products in ways that are right for you. You can continue to manage your privacy settings at any time and\\nwe’re committed to letting you know if we make important changes to how we collect, use and share your information.\\nIn addition, we’re updating our\\nTerms of Service\\nto\\nbetter explain what is expected from us and those who use our platforms. These expectations include the rights and obligations described in our Community Standards, for example when we may disable or terminate accounts that violate our Terms or Community Standards or others’ intellectual property rights or other laws. Some Terms of Service changes match updates to our Privacy Policy, including additional details about what happens when you delete content.\\nNotifications that people will start to receive today on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger will direct them to information about what to expect from the relevant Privacy Policy and Terms of Service in their region. They’ll also see a summary of what’s different. These updates go into effect on July 26, and people don’t need to act on this notification by this date to continue using our products.\\nThe updated Meta Privacy Policy covers Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and\\nother Meta products\\n. It doesn’t cover WhatsApp, Workplace, Free Basics, Messenger Kids or the use of Quest devices without a Facebook account, which have their own privacy policies.\\nResponding To Feedback and Evolving Regulation\\nAs privacy and data protection regulations have improved around the world in recent years, we’ve\\nexplored\\nideas in people-centered privacy design and have worked to make our data practices more transparent. The updates we’re announcing today are inspired by feedback from privacy experts, policymakers, and people who use our services. Our aim going forward is to update our Privacy Policy more frequently as we continue to learn what areas we can improve.\\nWe encourage everyone to read our updated Policy which will help people understand how our practices apply, including up to date information about our newer products, like Shops and Facebook View, as we continue to innovate. We’ve added more examples about the kinds of information we collect to provide the personalized services people expect, like recommended content and suggested connections. We’ve also included more details about the types of third-parties with whom we share and receive information and explained how and why people’s information is shared across our products, among other changes. Our updated policy has more details about information we collect if you use our products but don’t have an account and when we share information with law enforcement for the purposes of safety and security. For a summary of other key changes to our Privacy Policy, you can review\\nthis page\\n.\\nPrivacy Center\\nEarlier this year, we began to roll out\\nPrivacy Center\\nas a place where people can learn more about Meta’s approach to privacy across our apps and technologies. Privacy Center is now available to everyone who uses Facebook on desktop and mobile and connects directly to our updated Privacy Policy.\\nYou can think of Privacy Center as a hub for your privacy questions, where you can learn about how we use data, make use of some of the various privacy controls that we offer, and brush up on key account security tips and tools. We’ll also continue adding more guides and controls to it.\\nUpdating\\nControls for Your Privacy\\nNew Audience Controls:\\nStarting today, we’re also rolling out a new setting to make it easier to manage who sees your posts on Facebook. Now, when someone selects a default audience, that audience selection will apply to new posts created in Facebook that they share to their timeline unless they select a different audience for a particular post. Previously, your default audience for posts matched whichever audience you chose most recently. So if you had just made a post that was available to the public, your subsequent posts would be as well. This\\nnew setting\\nwill help make sure you’re sharing with the right people in your community.\\nNew Ways to Manage the Ads You See:\\nRecently\\n, we consolidated the Ad Topics and Interest Categories controls into a single control that can be accessed on Facebook and Instagram, covering a more extensive set of ad topics.\\nThis allows people\\nto use a single control to set preferences across ad topics that reflect the interest targeting categories advertisers may use to reach them and the content they might see in an ad.\\nDownloads\\n5 things to know about Meta's Privacy Policy update\\nCategories\\n:\\nData and Privacy\\nMeta\\nPublic Policy\\nTags:\\nPrivacy Matters\\nDOWNLOAD ALL IMAGES\\nShare this article\\nRecent News\\nExpanding Our Data Center Community Action Grants Program\\nFacebook Marketplace Gets a Glow Up\\nMeta’s 30th Data Center: Delivering AI, Creating Community Benefits, and Supporting Wetlands Restoration\\nHow Meta’s Data Centers Drive Economic Growth Across the US\\nRelated News\\nMeta\\nReflecting on Meta’s $8 Billion Investment in Privacy\\nJanuary 28, 2025\\nJuly 9, 2025\\nMeta\\nPrivacy Conversations: Risk Management and AI With Susan Cooper and Bojana Belamy\\nAugust 14, 2025\\nAugust 14, 2025\\nFollow Meta Newsroom\\nPress Resources\\npress@meta.com\\nMedia Gallery\\nFacebook\\nMeta Store\\nRay-Ban Meta glasses\\nOakley Meta glasses\\nMeta Quest\\nAccessories\\nApps and games\\nMeta Quest gift cards\\nRefurbished Meta Quest 3\\nRefurbished Meta Quest 3S\\nRefurbished Ray-Ban Meta glasses\\nMore from Ray-Ban\\nMeta Quest: Play now.

Your online safety shouldnât stop with Google â it should extend to the whole internet. Thatâs why we continue to innovate privacy technologies and make them widely available. We share our learnings, experiences, and tools with partners, organizations, and competitors, because keeping the internet safe requires everyone to work together.\\nKeeping the internet open, private, and safe is at the core of everything we do.

Web & App Activity auto-delete will also default to 18 months for new accounts. This means your activity data will be automatically and continuously deleted after 18 months, rather than kept until you choose to delete it. You can always turn these settings off or change your auto-delete setting at any time.\\nLearn more\\nPlay video\\nPause video\\nBlocking access\\nWe never sell your personal information, and give you controls over who has access\\nWe are committed to protecting your data from third parties. Thatâs why itâs our strict policy to never sell your personal information to anyone. We donât share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the Tap to Call button, weâll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop. If youâre using an Android device, we require third-party apps to ask for your permission to access certain types of data â like your photos, contacts, or location.\\nView our Privacy Policy\\nPlay video\\nPause video\\nData transparency\\nMaking it easy to view and delete your data\\nHow you use our products and services is a personal choice thatâs up to you. To help you make informed decisions about what data to save, share, or delete, we make it easy to understand what data is being collected and why.\\nFor example, with Dashboard, you can see an overview of the Google products you use and the things you store, like your emails and photos. And with My Activity, itâs easy to see or delete data collected from your activity across Google services, including things youâve searched, viewed, and watched.\\nGo to your Google Account\\nPlay video\\nPause video\\nData portability\\nEmpowering you to take your data with you\\nEvery user should have access to the content theyâve shared with us â anytime and for any reason.

This allows us to create services that are more helpful. For example, in Google Maps you can see how busy a place will be before you go there, based on millions of anonymized data points.\\nLearn more\\nFederated Learning\\nBuilding helpful products with less data\\nFederated learning is a data-minimization technology pioneered at Google that brings machine learning (ML) intelligence right to your device. This new approach combines anonymized information from different devices to train ML models. Federated learning helps preserve your privacy by keeping as much personal information on your device as possible.\\nLearn more\\nOpen-Source Privacy Technologies\\nSharing our privacy protections and innovations\\nWe are committed to constantly improving the privacy protections we offer and sharing these advancements with others. Thatâs why we open-source our advanced anonymization and data minimization technologies, like differential privacy, federated learning, and Private Join and Compute. Itâs our hope that these open-source tools help produce insights that benefit everyone while still protecting individual privacy.\\n1\\n/\\nWe are committed to complying with applicable data-protection laws\\nWe are always working to stay compliant with applicable privacy regulations.

It also identifies where you can go to get more information and to find tools and controls for managing your data. This is not meant to replace our Data Policy, and we don't address everything here. Read the full\\nData Policy\\nUnderstanding Data: What Information Do We Collect\\nWe collect information about you and your activity, on and off Facebook and Instagram. There's lots of information in our Data Policy about the kinds of information we collect, with some examples and links to where you can learn more. But here are some of the categories of things we receive: the content you provide when you post, like or comment, your connections, your transactions, and your usage of our products. We also collect information that other people provide about you, like when they tag you in a photo. We also collect information from your device, such as identifiers, cookies, and information you can control using your device settings, including your camera, microphone and different kinds of location information, along with information from our partners, like websites you visit, apps you use or purchases you make.\\nSharing Your Data\\nData allows us to provide a personalized experience to different people, and to learn new things and improve our service. There's lots of information in our Data Policy about the ways we use the information we have, with some examples and links to where you can learn more. But here are some of the ways we use data:\\nPeople and accounts on Instagram, depending on the audience you choose, your settings, and the features you use. Remember that public information can be seen by anyone.\\nServices (like apps and websites) you choose to give access to your Instagram information, like if you use a service to see all your social media together. You can revoke their access to your information,\\nhere.\\nAdvertisers. We help advertisers understand whether their ads are effective. We also share with companies that help to make reports for advertisers.\\nCompanies that offer things through Instagram, like if you buy something and provide your shipping address.\\nVendors and service providers we hire to help us with our business.\\nResearchers and academics, like to try to understand how to stop bullying and harassment online.\\nLegal requests (like from a court or law enforcement), when consistent with the law and our policies.\\nHow To Access and Download Your Data\\nA great first step to controlling your online data is to understand what you’ve shared. We offer tools to review the information we have for your account and the data you’ve shared on Instagram. You’ll see information we have about you, as well as your content, like your posts, comments, and messages. Learn how to use these tools in our\\nHelp Center.\\nHow to Delete Your Data\\nSometimes people change their minds about things they’ve shared online. To delete a photo or video that you've posted, tap above your post and then tap Delete. You can also\\narchive posts\\nto hide them from your profile and make it so your followers and other people on Instagram can't see it. But don’t worry—when you archive a post, it keeps all its likes and comments.\\nYou can also temporarily disable or delete your account at any time. When you delete your account, we delete your posts, and you won't be able to recover that information later.\\nLearn more.\\nAnything that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted if you delete your account. But, if you are concerned about a picture or information someone else has posted about you, you can report it to us. See how “To report a post,” above.\\nRELATED ARTICLES\\nCheck out more announcements about Instagram\\n#ANNOUNCEMENTS\\nEdit and Restyle Instagram Stories Using Meta AI\\n#ANNOUNCEMENTS\\nInstagram Teen Accounts Will Be Guided by PG-13 Ratings\\n#ANNOUNCEMENTS\\nProtecting Teens & Schools: Instagram’s New Safety Programs\\nOur Story\\nLeadership\\nBrand\\nBrand Kit\\nWorking at Instagram\\nPolitics\\nFeatures\\nReels\\nStories\\nDMs\\nSearch & Explore\\nSafety\\nSafety Tools\\nPrivacy Tools\\nAccount Security\\nCommunity\\nSchool Partnerships\\nTeen Accounts\\nAnti-Bullying\\nParents\\nPrograms\\nThreads\\nEdits\\nBusiness\\nCreators\\nNews\\nMeta\\nFamily Center\\nHelp Center\\n/>\\n/>\\nOur Story\\nFeatures\\nSafety\\nNews\\nMeta\\n/>\\n/>\\nEnglish (US)\\nEnglish (US)\\nSelect your preference.\\nLanguages\\nEnglish (US)\\nEspañol\\nFrançais (France)\\nPortuguês (Brasil)\\n한국어\\nDeutsch\\n日本語\\nहिन्दी\\nItaliano\\nInstagram from Meta\\nAPI\\nPrivacy\\nTerms\\nSitemap\\nAPI\\nPrivacy\\nTerms\\nSitemap\\n\\nRespond ONLY with valid JSON.

And we’ve paired it with the Privacy Center and new controls to manage your experience, like who sees your posts and the topics you want to see ads about.\\nStarting today, Meta is rolling out notifications letting people know that we’ve updated our\\nPrivacy Policy\\n, formerly known as the Data Policy. Inspired by feedback from people who use our technologies and privacy experts, we rewrote our Privacy Policy to make it easier to understand and to reflect the latest products we offer. While the text looks different in many places,\\nMeta is not collecting, using or sharing your data in new ways based on this policy update and\\nwe still do not sell your information.\\nOur goal with this update is to be more clear about our data practices; one way we’ve done this is through additional details and examples throughout. At Meta, we’ve always set out to build personalized experiences that provide value without compromising your privacy. So, it’s on us to have strong protections for the data we use and be transparent about how we use it. That includes\\ncommunicating more clearly\\nabout our data practices and the choices you have.\\nWe’re also including more ways to access controls you can use to experience our products in ways that are right for you. You can continue to manage your privacy settings at any time and\\nwe’re committed to letting you know if we make important changes to how we collect, use and share your information.\\nIn addition, we’re updating our\\nTerms of Service\\nto\\nbetter explain what is expected from us and those who use our platforms. These expectations include the rights and obligations described in our Community Standards, for example when we may disable or terminate accounts that violate our Terms or Community Standards or others’ intellectual property rights or other laws. Some Terms of Service changes match updates to our Privacy Policy, including additional details about what happens when you delete content.\\nNotifications that people will start to receive today on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger will direct them to information about what to expect from the relevant Privacy Policy and Terms of Service in their region. They’ll also see a summary of what’s different. These updates go into effect on July 26, and people don’t need to act on this notification by this date to continue using our products.\\nThe updated Meta Privacy Policy covers Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and\\nother Meta products\\n. It doesn’t cover WhatsApp, Workplace, Free Basics, Messenger Kids or the use of Quest devices without a Facebook account, which have their own privacy policies.\\nResponding To Feedback and Evolving Regulation\\nAs privacy and data protection regulations have improved around the world in recent years, we’ve\\nexplored\\nideas in people-centered privacy design and have worked to make our data practices more transparent. The updates we’re announcing today are inspired by feedback from privacy experts, policymakers, and people who use our services. Our aim going forward is to update our Privacy Policy more frequently as we continue to learn what areas we can improve.\\nWe encourage everyone to read our updated Policy which will help people understand how our practices apply, including up to date information about our newer products, like Shops and Facebook View, as we continue to innovate. We’ve added more examples about the kinds of information we collect to provide the personalized services people expect, like recommended content and suggested connections. We’ve also included more details about the types of third-parties with whom we share and receive information and explained how and why people’s information is shared across our products, among other changes. Our updated policy has more details about information we collect if you use our products but don’t have an account and when we share information with law enforcement for the purposes of safety and security. For a summary of other key changes to our Privacy Policy, you can review\\nthis page\\n.\\nPrivacy Center\\nEarlier this year, we began to roll out\\nPrivacy Center\\nas a place where people can learn more about Meta’s approach to privacy across our apps and technologies. Privacy Center is now available to everyone who uses Facebook on desktop and mobile and connects directly to our updated Privacy Policy.\\nYou can think of Privacy Center as a hub for your privacy questions, where you can learn about how we use data, make use of some of the various privacy controls that we offer, and brush up on key account security tips and tools. We’ll also continue adding more guides and controls to it.\\nUpdating\\nControls for Your Privacy\\nNew Audience Controls:\\nStarting today, we’re also rolling out a new setting to make it easier to manage who sees your posts on Facebook. Now, when someone selects a default audience, that audience selection will apply to new posts created in Facebook that they share to their timeline unless they select a different audience for a particular post. Previously, your default audience for posts matched whichever audience you chose most recently. So if you had just made a post that was available to the public, your subsequent posts would be as well.

Web & App Activity auto-delete will also default to 18 months for new accounts.

Thatâs why itâs our strict policy to never sell your personal information to anyone. We donât share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the Tap to Call button, weâll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.

This allows us to create services that are more helpful. For example, in Google Maps you can see how busy a place will be before you go there, based on millions of anonymized data points.\\nLearn more\\nFederated Learning\\nBuilding helpful products with less data\\nFederated learning is a data-minimization technology pioneered at Google that brings machine learning (ML) intelligence right to your device. This new approach combines anonymized information from different devices to train ML models. Federated learning helps preserve your privacy by keeping as much personal information on your device as possible.\\nLearn more\\nOpen-Source Privacy Technologies\\nSharing our privacy protections and innovations\\nWe are committed to constantly improving the privacy protections we offer and sharing these advancements with others. Thatâs why we open-source our advanced anonymization and data minimization technologies, like differential privacy, federated learning, and Private Join and Compute. Itâs our hope that these open-source tools help produce insights that benefit everyone while still protecting individual privacy.\\n1\\n/\\nWe are committed to complying with applicable data-protection laws\\nWe are always working to stay compliant with applicable privacy regulations.
