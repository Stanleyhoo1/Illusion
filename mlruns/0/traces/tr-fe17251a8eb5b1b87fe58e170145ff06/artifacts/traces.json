The nascent company was merely a search engine, and Gmail, Android and YouTube were but glimmers in the startup’s eye. Google’s first privacy policy reflected that simplicity. It was short and earnest, a quaint artifact of a different time in Silicon Valley, when Google offered 600 words to explain how it was collecting and using personal information.\\\\n\\\\nThat version of the internet (and Google) is gone. Over the past 20 years, that same privacy policy has been rewritten into a sprawling 4,000-word explanation of the company’s data practices.\\\\n\\\\nThis evolution, across two decades and 30 versions, is the story of the internet’s transformation through the eyes of one of its most crucial entities. The web is now terribly complex, and Google has a privacy policy to match.\\\\n\\\\nGoogle’s Privacy Policy Over Time 1999 Google is sensitive to the privacy concerns of its users. The Internet allows individuals to explore and communicate with unprecedented ease, but it also allows websites to collect and distribute personal information with equal ease. We at Google know that many users are, understandably, concerned about such practices, and we wish to make clear our policy for collecting and using personal information. Google’s Policy Google’s policy on our wholly controlled and operated Internet sites is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. Google does not willfully disclose individually identifiable information about its customers to any third party without first receiving that customer’s permission. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it. Google may share information about users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we only talk about our users in aggregate, not as individuals. For example, we may disclose how frequently the average Google user visits Google, or which other query words are most often used with the query word “Microsoft.” From time to time, there may be situations where Google asks you for personal information. When we intend to use your personal information, we tell you up front. This way you can decide whether you want to give us the information or not. In case you change your mind or some personal information changes, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us. Google and Cookies Upon your first visit to Google, Google sends a “cookie” to your computer. A cookie is a file that identifies you as a unique user. It can also store personal preferences and user data. A cookie can tell us, “This is the same individual who visited Google two days ago” but it cannot tell us, “This person is Joe Smith” or even, “This person lives in the United States.” Google uses cookies to track user trends and patterns, in order to better understand our user base and to improve the quality of our service. Google may also choose to use cookies to store user preferences. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of Google may not function properly if you refuse cookies. Links to Other Sites The page that comes up after “clicking” on a result URL is likely to be outside the Google site and beyond our control. Other links, such as for the Google-friends mailing list archive, are also on sites not controlled by Google. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Google may choose to exhibit its search results in the form of a “URL redirecter.” When a URL redirecter is used, whenever you “click” on a URL from a search result, information about the “click” is sent to Google, which then sends you to the site you clicked on. Google uses this URL information to understand and improve the quality of Google’s search technology. For instance, Google uses this information to determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results. Google’s policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Google’s control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. We reserve the right at our discretion to make changes to this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. 2009 At Google we recognize that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by Google Inc. or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies except DoubleClick (DoubleClick Privacy Policy) and Postini (Postini Privacy Policy); collectively, Google’s “services.” In addition, where more detailed information is needed to explain our privacy practices, we post supplementary privacy notices to describe how particular services process personal information. These notices can be found in the Google Privacy Center. Google adheres to the US Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement, and is registered with the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor Program. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us through our website or write to us at Privacy Matters c/o Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, California, 94043 USA Information we collect and how we use it We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information to us, such as Google Search. In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information: Information you provide – When you sign up for a Google Account or other Google service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password). For certain services, such as our advertising programs, we also request credit card or other payment account information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers. We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other Google services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information. Cookies – When you visit Google, we send one or more cookies – a small file containing a string of characters – to your computer or other device that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, improving search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends, such as how people search. Google also uses cookies in its advertising services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. We may set one or more cookies in your browser when you visit a website, including Google sites that use our advertising cookies, and view or click on an ad supported by Google’s advertising services. Log information – When you access Google services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. User communications – When you send email or other communications to Google, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. Affiliated Google Services on other sites – We offer some of our services on or through other web sites. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to Google in order to deliver the service. We process such information under this Privacy Policy. The affiliated sites through which our services are offered may have different privacy practices and we encourage you to read their privacy policies. Gadgets – Google may make available third party applications through its services. The information collected by Google when you enable a gadget or other application is processed under this Privacy Policy. Information collected by the application or gadget provider is governed by their privacy policies. Location data – Google offers location-enabled services, such as Google Maps for mobile. If you use those services, Google may receive information about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate a location (such as a cell ID). Links – Google may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality of our search technology, customized content and advertising. Read more information about links and redirected URLs. Other sites – This Privacy Policy applies to Google services only. We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as search results, sites that include Google applications, products or services, or links from within our various services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Google only processes personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and/or the supplementary privacy notices for specific services. In addition to the above, such purposes include: Providing our services, including the display of customized content and advertising; Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services; Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; Protecting the rights or property of Google or our users; and Developing new services. You can find more information about how we process personal information by referring to the supplementary privacy notices for particular services. Google processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country. We may process personal information to provide our own services. In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising partners. Choices for personal information When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service privacy notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the supplementary service privacy notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Google features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. Google uses the DoubleClick advertising cookie on AdSense partner sites and certain Google services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. You can view, edit, and manage your ads preferences associated with this cookie by accessing the Ads Preferences Manager. In addition, you may choose to opt out of the DoubleClick cookie at any time by using DoubleClick’s opt-out cookie. You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case Google may not be able to provide those services to you. Information sharing Google only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Google in the following limited circumstances: We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information. We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, its users or the public as required or permitted by law. If Google becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually. Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data. Information security We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. Data integrity Google processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services or as otherwise permitted under this Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary. Accessing and updating personal information When you use Google services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users’ personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services. Enforcement Google regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or Google’s treatment of personal information by contacting us through this web site or by writing to us at Privacy Matters c/o Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, California, 94043 USA When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is Google’s policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Google and an individual. Changes to this Privacy Policy Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). Each version of this Privacy Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and we will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review. If you have any additional questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us any time through this web site or at 2019 When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information. Effective January 22, 2019 | Archived versions | Download PDF We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include: Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads and embedded Google Maps You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used. To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us. INFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls. When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions. When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information. Things you create or provide to us When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services.

We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request. We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and which apps you've installed. Your activity We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like.

You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account. Go to Google Account Your location information We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions for your weekend getaway or showtimes for movies playing near you. Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by: GPS IP address Sensor data from your device Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Google’s Policy Google’s policy on our wholly controlled and operated Internet sites is to respect and protect the privacy of our users.

These include:\\\\n\\\\n- GPS and other sensor data from your device\\\\n\\\\n- IP address\\\\n\\\\n- Activity on Google services, such as from your searches or places you label like home or work\\\\n\\\\n- Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices\\\\n\\\\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings.

And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\\\\n\\\\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\\\\n\\\\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\\\\n\\\\n# Why Google collects data\\\\n\\\\n## We use data to build better services\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\\\\n\\\\n### Provide our services\\\\n\\\\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\\\\n\\\\n### Maintain & improve our services\\\\n\\\\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\\\\n\\\\n### Develop new services\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\\\\n\\\\n### Provide personalized services, including content and ads\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\\\\n\\\\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\\\\n\\\\nGo to My Ad Center\\\\n\\\\n### Measure performance\\\\n\\\\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\\\\n\\\\n### Communicate with you\\\\n\\\\n### Protect Google, our users, and the public\\\\n\\\\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\\\\n\\\\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\\\\n\\\\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.\\\\n\\\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\\\\n\\\\n# Your privacy controls\\\\n\\\\n## You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\\\\n\\\\nGo to Privacy Checkup\\\\n\\\\n## Managing, reviewing, and updating your information\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.\\\\n\\\\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:\\\\n\\\\n### Privacy controls\\\\n\\\\n### Activity Controls\\\\n\\\\nDecide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Activity Controls\\\\n\\\\n### Ad settings\\\\n\\\\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.

You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.\\\\n\\\\nGo to My Activity\\\\n\\\\n### Google Dashboard\\\\n\\\\nGoogle Dashboard allows you to manage information associated with specific products.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Dashboard\\\\n\\\\n### Your personal information\\\\n\\\\nManage your contact information, such as your name, email, and phone number.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Personal Info\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed out, you can manage information associated with your browser or device, including:\\\\n\\\\n- Signed-out search personalization: Choose whether your search activity is used to offer you more relevant results and recommendations.\\\\n\\\\n- YouTube settings: Pause and delete your YouTube Search History and your YouTube Watch History.\\\\n\\\\n- Ad Settings: Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.\\\\n\\\\n## Exporting, removing & deleting your information\\\\n\\\\nYou can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.\\\\n\\\\nExport your data\\\\n\\\\nTo delete your information, you can:\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your content from specific Google services\\\\n\\\\n- Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\\\\n\\\\n- Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your entire Google Account\\\\n\\\\nDelete your information\\\\n\\\\nInactive Account Manager allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account.\\\\n\\\\nAnd finally, you can also request to remove content from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.\\\\n\\\\nThere are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:\\\\n\\\\n- Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a cookie in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.\\\\n\\\\n- Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\\\\n\\\\n# Sharing your information\\\\n\\\\n## When you share your information\\\\n\\\\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.\\\\n\\\\n## When Google shares your information\\\\n\\\\nWe do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:\\\\n\\\\n### With your consent\\\\n\\\\nWe’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.\\\\n\\\\n### With domain administrators\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:\\\\n\\\\n- Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email\\\\n\\\\n- View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install\\\\n\\\\n- Change your account password\\\\n\\\\n- Suspend or terminate your account access\\\\n\\\\n- Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request\\\\n\\\\n- Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings\\\\n\\\\n### For external processing\\\\n\\\\n### For legal reasons\\\\n\\\\nWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\\\\n\\\\n- Respond to any applicable law, regulation,legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.\\\\n\\\\n- Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.\\\\n\\\\n- Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public.\\\\n\\\\nWe may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.\\\\n\\\\n# Keeping your information secure\\\\n\\\\n## We build security into our services to protect your information\\\\n\\\\nAll Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.\\\\n\\\\nWe work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:\\\\n\\\\n- We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit\\\\n\\\\n- We offer a range of security features, like Safe Browsing, Security Checkup, and 2 Step Verification to help you protect your account\\\\n\\\\n- We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems\\\\n\\\\n- We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.\\\\n\\\\n# Exporting & deleting your information\\\\n\\\\nYou can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your content from specific Google services\\\\n\\\\n- Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\\\\n\\\\n- Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your entire Google Account\\\\n\\\\n# Retaining your information\\\\n\\\\nWe retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:\\\\n\\\\n- Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your personal info or the content you create or upload, like photos and documents. You can also delete activity information saved in your account, or choose to have it deleted automatically after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.\\\\n\\\\n- Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as advertising data in server logs.\\\\n\\\\n- We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.\\\\n\\\\n- And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.\\\\n\\\\n# Compliance & cooperation with regulators\\\\n\\\\n## Data transfers\\\\n\\\\nWe maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data.\\\\n\\\\nWhen we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.\\\\n\\\\n## U.S. state law requirements\\\\n\\\\nSome U.S. state privacy laws require specific disclosures.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain the categories of information Google collects and the sources of that information in Information Google collects.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain the purposes for which Google collects and uses information in Why Google collects data.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain when Google may disclose information in Sharing your information. Google does not sell your personal information. Google also does not “share” your personal information as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\\\\n\\\\n- We explain how Google retains information in Retaining your information. You can also learn more about how Google anonymizes data. As described there, when Google anonymizes data to protect your privacy, we maintain policies and technical measures to avoid re-identifying that information.\\\\n\\\\nU.S. state privacy laws also provide the right to request information about how Google collects, uses, and discloses your information. And they give you the right to access your information, sometimes in a portable format; correct your information; and to request that Google delete that information. Many of these laws also provide the right to opt out of certain forms of profiling and targeted advertising.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy.

The first time you turn on Location History — which is off by default — your auto-delete option will be set to 18 months by default. Web & App Activity auto-delete will also default to 18 months for new accounts. This means your activity data will be automatically and continuously deleted after 18 months, rather than kept until you choose to delete it.

If you do not agree to these Terms, then do not access or use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms.”\\\\n\\\\nThe wording here includes a sentence that’s currently buried further down in the terms, making it clear that by using its apps, you are indeed agreeing to these terms.\\\\n\\\\nThe update also includes more specific explanations around misuse of Meta’s apps, and the scraping of data from them.\\\\n\\\\n“You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data you do not have permission to access, regardless of whether such automated access or collection is undertaken while logged-in to a Facebook account.”\\\\n\\\\nThat last sentence has been added, clarifying that you can’t use the fact that you were logged into Facebook as an excuse for data scraping. This distinction, between logged in and logged out access, has been used in the legal defense of some scraping cases.\\\\n\\\\nThere’s also a new explanation about circumventing Meta’s protection measures, and how that’s also a no-no.\\\\n\\\\nMeta’s also included some specific qualifiers on avatar and AI use, based on its separate agreements for each:\\\\n\\\\n“If you use Avatars, then the Avatar Terms also apply. If you use our AI products and features, the Meta AI Terms also apply. To the extent any supplemental terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAs noted, the references to its separate Avatar and Meta AI terms here are new, ensuring that these documents, which already exist, are also specifically noted within the initial user agreement.\\\\n\\\\nMeta’s Avatar and AI terms cover the use of your personal data inputs for these elements, including, say, selfie videos for avatar creation, or the sharing of your conversations with Meta’s AI tools with third parties.\\\\n\\\\nWhy would Meta need to share your AI chats? Well, it might need to pass on your query to Google or Bing to get search results from the web, though the terms also cover any internal reviews of your AI prompts and other usage.\\\\n\\\\nSo there’s a range of things that you’re agreeing to, which are not new, as such, but are now being more explicitly built into Meta’s usage agreements.\\\\n\\\\nOn its Community Standards, Meta’s not actually updating the document, but it is merging its Community Standards that cover Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and Threads into one central location for easier access.\\\\n\\\\nSo if you see this new prompt, now you’ll know what it is you’re agreeing to.\\\\n\\\\n- purchase licensing rights\\\\n\\\\n### Social Media Today news delivered to your inbox\\\\n\\\\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\\\\n\\\\n- Retrieved from Daniel Oberhaus/Wikimedia Commons on April 18, 2022 Tracker The Complete Elon Musk–Twitter Saga For months, we’ve been tracking Elon Musk’s $44 billion deal with Twitter.

This publication represents our company’s views on AI and creativity.\\\\n\\\\n--\\\\n\\\\nDid you get an email from the Zuck this morning? I did and if you’re one of the billions still roaming around the social network that defined so much of our modern perspective, you should really read up on the changes.\\\\n\\\\nBut who in the world has time for that? So, my friend ChatPDF and I are here to help. Yes, this is what we at Credtent.org call an AI-Assisted piece of content because I used ChatPDF to help analyze the update and find some bugaboos that might be worth a second look. This is what I often tell people — use AI to help protect yourself against AI.\\\\n\\\\nLet me disclose clearly that I am not an attorney and this is NOT legal advice. It’s just what a read of the TOS changes means from both an AI’s analysis and my own personal take on this coming from the perspective of someone whose life and work (as Credtent’s founder) is focused on making sure content creators are protected in the Age of AI. I’d note that ChatGPT’s Canvas helped me organize my thoughts as well, but I’ve rewritten most of its output because I’m a writer, not an #AISlacker. Still, this qualifies as AI-Assisted Content because I used AI as my collaborator.\\\\n\\\\nNow, with the disclosures out of the way, here’s the meat of the article.\\\\n\\\\nBelow, you’ll see an outline of what’s changing, what it means for you, and why you might want to reconsider your relationship with the platform. Sound like a good time? No, not really. But I hope this proves easier than parsing the legalese yourself.\\\\n\\\\n## What’s Changing?\\\\n\\\\nHere’s a breakdown of the major updates compared to the existing terms:\\\\n\\\\n- Data Usage: Facebook emphasizes that it doesn’t sell personal data but uses it extensively to deliver targeted ads and sponsored content. They also admit to leveraging advanced technologies (hello, AI!) for “research and development”. What could go wrong there?\\\\n\\\\n- Legacy Contacts: You can now appoint someone to manage your account posthumously. This sounds convenient and, to be honest, I’ve found it painful to see the occasional suggestion of a friend who I know has passed. But it opens the door to new privacy concerns, post-mortem.\\\\n\\\\n- Unilateral Terms Updates: By simply using the platform, you consent to any future changes. In other words, your agreement is automatic — whether or not you like the changes. If you stay on FB, you don’t need to accept terms — you’re opting in automagically.\\\\n\\\\n- Content Rights: Facebook retains broad rights over content you upload, including intellectual property. While it’s unclear how far this stretches, it raises questions about whether your creative work could be appropriated for purposes like AI training to produce work based on your own. We’ve already seen how FB content has been used in advertising without compensation or credit. This could get much worse.\\\\n\\\\n## Concerns for Content Creators\\\\n\\\\nIf you create content, Facebook’s new terms should raise a bright red flag. Here’s why:\\\\n\\\\n- AI Training Ambiguity: Meta admits to using AI and machine learning but stops short of specifying whether your content is used for training purposes. This lack of transparency leaves creators vulnerable to their work being exploited. Based on the past history of this and, frankly, most technology platforms, I’d be inclined to not trust this omission as being innocent.\\\\n\\\\n- Intellectual Property: While you retain ownership of your content, Facebook’s broad license to “use” it creates a gray area. What stops them from repurposing your video or photo for marketing campaigns — or worse, feeding it into an AI model to allows for creation of content that is competitive to your own?\\\\n\\\\n- Control Erosion: By continuing to use the platform, you implicitly are agreeing to future terms, giving Facebook a blank check to rewrite the rules as they see fit. Again, what could go wrong? We can’t know!\\\\n\\\\n## What’s at Stake for All Users\\\\n\\\\nEven if you’re not a content creator worried about your work being used against your future success, there’s still plenty to worry about:\\\\n\\\\n- Privacy: Meta claims it protects user privacy, but vague language about data analysis and AI leaves you wondering how much of your information is truly secure.\\\\n\\\\n- Account Management: Accounts can be (and have been) disabled (by Meta) for unclear violations. What happens to years of uploaded content if you’re suddenly locked out? This already happened to me once because of a scam. I tried to contact support but Meta made it nigh impossible to do anything about it — although scammers kept writing to me saying they could restore it for a fee. That’s some excellent customer service, huh?\\\\n\\\\n- Transparency: The absence of clear disclosures about AI training practices sets a dangerous precedent for big tech. If Facebook doesn’t explicitly outline its policies, who will? This is a bigger deal than you might think if you’re posting all kinds of pictures of yourself, your children, and your home.\\\\n\\\\n## Long-Term Repercussions\\\\n\\\\nSticking with Facebook post-2025 might begin to feel like maintaining access to a popular party or tribe while sacrificing your autonomy. The long-term risks include:\\\\n\\\\n- AI Entrapment: Your creative content could be mined to improve AI tools, with no opt-out clause. Imagine contributing to technology that competes with or devalues your own work. That said, Credtent.org IS sending opt-out requests to Meta for registered Credtent users. The legal fight over this dicey policy is coming so we’re preparing users for it.\\\\n\\\\n- Data Monopoly: The more data Facebook collects, the stronger its grip on user behavior and advertising markets. Users could face fewer alternatives as competitors struggle to keep up. Worse, how much (and how often) will Facebook sell their information to adtech and data brokers that can extrapolate a lot about you from your behavior. However much information you think is out there about you, let me be blunt — it’s 10X worse.\\\\n\\\\n- Legal Precedents: If unchecked, Facebook’s practices may influence other platforms to adopt similar, creator-unfriendly terms. I can’t imagine anybody wanting BlueSky, Medium and other sensible platforms to edge into these terms over time because we were just accepting them getting worse and worse.\\\\n\\\\n## What Should You Do?\\\\n\\\\nHere are some actionable strategies to start today to better protect yourself:\\\\n\\\\n- Diversify Platforms: Share your work on platforms like BlueSky, which explicitly refuses to train on user content, or Medium for long-form writing. This is what I am doing now. I’m also on Substack, although you need to directly opt-out of their use of your work for AI training.\\\\n\\\\n- Minimize Uploads: Use Facebook to post links to your external content rather than uploading original files directly. FB’s algorithm dings you for outbound links but it’s probably worth it in the end.\\\\n\\\\n- Monitor Updates: Keep an eye on Meta’s future changes and reconsider your use of the platform as needed. If it’s still worth it to you, have at it. For me, the camel’s back was broken years ago. I’m just getting tired of the pile of straw gathering on the poor thing.\\\\n\\\\n- Advocate for Regulation: Push for transparency and ethical AI practices in the tech industry. Your voice matters. Join Credtent.org to help fight back against unethical AI theft of your person and content.\\\\n\\\\n## Now is time to say goodbye to Meta\\\\n\\\\nMeta’s new terms make one thing clear: Using Facebook in 2025 comes with a huge knot of strings attached. Whether you’re a content creator or just someone who values privacy, now is the time to rethink your digital footprint. The platform may remain convenient (and “free” unless you’re an advertiser), but the cost — measured in rights and data — is higher than ever.\\\\n\\\\nFor me, I’m reducing my footprint to just posting links to my personal work elsewhere.

WE EXPLAIN SOME EXCEPTIONS AND HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION BELOW.\\\\n\\\\n1. MPT Products. Meta offers a variety of hardware and software products and services related to or in connection with those products as part of Meta Platforms Technologies. The hardware, services, features, apps, technologies, and software that are subject to these terms include the Meta VR Products and other Meta Platform Technologies products listed here, which may be updated from time to time (“MPT Products”).\\\\n\\\\n1.1. Accounts. We want our platform to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to agree to a few requirements before you can create an account to use our MPT Products:\\\\n\\\\n1.1.a. You must be at least 13 years of age to create one or more accounts supported by a MPT Product, such as a Meta account. You may create a Meta account on behalf of your child ages 10 to 12. When your child turns 13, they will have 30 days to start managing their Meta account or they will be blocked from using their device. Meta accounts for children ages 10 to 12 may not be supported on all MPT Products, including Meta Wearable Products.\\\\n\\\\n1.1.c. You may use the same Meta account to access different MPT Products, or you may create multiple different Meta accounts. However, except between you and your child ages 10 to 12 for whom you have created an account, you may not share passwords or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission).\\\\n\\\\n1.1.d. You must provide us with accurate and up to date information (including registration information), which may include providing your or your child’s personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone you aren’t.\\\\n\\\\n1.2. Meta Company Products. We may make certain Meta Company Products available for use on MPT Products. You may need to add your Meta account and other account types (such as a Facebook or Instagram account) to the same Accounts Center in order to access certain features or services offered by Meta Company Products (for example, you may need to add your Meta account to the same Accounts Center as your Facebook account in order to share content from a MPT Product on Facebook). If you choose to use these Meta Company Products, your use of them is subject to the relevant terms and conditions, including minimum age requirements, for those Meta Company Products (including relevant data policies).\\\\n\\\\n2. Your Commitments to Meta and Our Community\\\\n\\\\n2.1. Your responsibility for your use of MPT Products. You may only use MPT Products for personal non-commercial purposes unless otherwise expressly permitted in these Supplemental Terms or authorized by us in writing. Except as expressly permitted by us, you may not copy, modify, prepare directive works, distribute, sell, lease, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast, hack, emulate, or otherwise exploit any part of our services and software. Unless we are prohibited from restricting you under applicable law, you also may not reverse engineer any of the MPT Products or try to derive any of the software used in the MPT Products. You are also responsible for complying with all applicable laws when using MPT Products, including providing any notice to or obtaining any consents from other individuals who you interact with on your MPT Products as may be required under video recording, audio recording, biometric data, or other privacy or data protection laws. You are responsible for using your MPT Products in a safe, lawful, and respectful manner. For example, you may not tamper with the MPT Products, or otherwise obscure or modify any features that are intended to signal to others that the product is recording.\\\\n\\\\n2.3. Your responsibility for other users of your MPT Product. Each person, including you, who uses your MPT Product is referred to in these Supplemental Terms as a user of such products. You are responsible for the activities of all users of your MPT Products, and for their consent to and compliance with these Supplemental Terms. We encourage you to monitor others who use your MPT Products.\\\\n\\\\n2.4. Your responsibility for your child’s use of a Meta account to access MPT Products. You are responsible for determining that your child is ready to use MPT Products, consistent with the Health and Safety Warnings (see 5.5.d). If your child is below 10 years of age or otherwise not ready to use MPT Products as determined by you, you must not create an account for them. You are responsible for the activities of your child when they use a Meta account to access MPT Products, and for their compliance with these Supplemental Terms. You are responsible for supervising your child’s access to and use of MPT Products. You are responsible for ensuring your child understands these Supplemental Terms as well as other Terms and Policies that may apply, such as the Code of Conduct for Virtual Experiences, and ensuring they understand how to behave and interact with others when accessing MPT Products.\\\\n\\\\n3. The Permissions You Give Us\\\\n\\\\n3.3. Permission to use your name, profile picture, and information about your actions with ads and sponsored or commercial content. You give us permission to use your profile name, profile picture, and information about actions you have taken in MPT Products (for example, apps you use) next to or in connection with ads, offers, and other sponsored or commercial content that we display in MPT Products without any compensation to you. Additionally, if you choose to connect your Meta account with other Meta Company Products accounts (such as your Facebook or Instagram accounts), you also give us permission to display your profile information and information about actions you have taken in MPT Products across Meta Company Products. Ads and content like this can be seen only by people who have your permission to see the actions you've taken in MPT Products consistent with your privacy settings.\\\\n\\\\n4. What You Can Share and Do on MPT Products\\\\n\\\\n4.1. Permission to use. If your MPT Product includes software applications, content, or virtual items other than Third-Party Services (“Software and Content”) that have been enabled for your use, we hereby grant you a personal, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited right and license to access, use, and download (as permitted by the functionality of the MPT Products) that Software and Content on MPT Products devices you own or control, solely for personal non-commercial purposes (except as expressly authorized by Meta in writing), conditioned on your compliance with these Supplemental Terms. Any unauthorized use of the MPT Products, including the Software and Content, is strictly prohibited and will cause the license granted in these Supplemental Terms to terminate automatically. No licenses or rights are granted to you by implication or otherwise, except for the licenses and rights expressly granted to you herein or in any other applicable terms. The Software and Content are the property of Meta, its affiliates, or its licensors, and are only licensed, not sold to you. Meta also requires that you use only the then-current version of the Software and Content.\\\\n\\\\n4.2. Third-Party Services. MPT Products can be used to access software, applications, services, content, and virtual items (including, but not limited to, third-party digital content, additional or enhanced functionality, or media content purchased through MPT Products) provided by third parties (“Third-Party Services”). In some cases, Meta or its affiliates may distribute Third-Party Services to you on behalf of the third party.\\\\n\\\\n4.2.a. Third-Party Terms. Your use of a Third-Party Service may be subject to additional terms, conditions, fees, and policies imposed by the third party (together, “Third-Party Terms”). Meta is not a party to these Third-Party Terms. However, in the event that Third-Party Terms conflict with the provisions of these Supplemental Terms, these Supplemental Terms will govern. You are responsible for complying with any applicable Third-Party Terms, and we recommend that you review any applicable Third-Party Terms before using Third-Party Services. We have no obligations or liability for (i) your access to or use of any Third-Party Services, (ii) any information that you provide or authorize us to provide to any Third-Party Services, or (iii) such third party’s collection, use, or disclosure of such information. If you have connected to a Third-Party Service on a MPT Product, you may remain connected using saved credentials unless you take action to discontinue access to that service (such as by changing the applicable account settings for the relevant Third-Party Service).\\\\n\\\\n4.2.b. Default End User License. If you are not presented with an end user license agreement when you acquire Third-Party Services, the following license terms apply to your use of such Third-Party Services: (a) the third party providing the Third-Party Services (and not Meta or its affiliates) is the licensor of such Third-Party Services; (b) such third party grants you a limited, non-transferable license to access and use the Third-Party Services only for your personal and non-commercial purposes; and (c) you may not modify, decompile or disassemble the Third-Party Services in whole or in part, or create any derivative works from or sublicense any rights in or to the Third-Party Services, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the third party or as permitted under applicable law notwithstanding these restrictions. Meta and its affiliates are not parties to the license agreement between you and the provider of such Third-Party Services or other Third-Party Terms.\\\\n\\\\n4.2.c. Discontinuation of Third-Party Services. Third-Party Services may require access to data about Meta users and Meta services, which access is subject to agreements between Third-Party Service providers and Meta. We may disable this access for a Third-Party Service if the Third-Party Service provider breaches these agreements, our policies, or applicable law, or if the agreements are otherwise terminated. This may adversely affect your use of such Third-Party Services, including by making such Third-Party Services partially or fully inoperable. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we will have no liability to you for removing or disabling access to data and services by a third party for these reasons. This means, without limitation, that Meta will not provide you with any refunds for such Third-Party Services in these cases. Any rights, including refund claims, which you may have under your agreements with third parties remain unaffected.\\\\n\\\\n4.4. Objectionable Content. We may display age, comfort, and content ratings for digital content (including ads) that are based on information provided to us by the developers of such content, and which are not verified by Meta, unless expressly mentioned. We cannot guarantee that digital content ratings will always be accurate, nor can we promise that you will not find some material harmful, inappropriate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable, including material that may be found through accessing third-party links or other Third-Party Services. You understand that you may be exposed to content from a variety of sources when using MPT Products and acknowledge that content may be inaccurate, inappropriate, offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable. You agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Meta will not be responsible or liable for content posted by you, other users of MPT Products, or a third party.\\\\n\\\\n4.5. Age Restrictions. You may only access certain digital content if you are of or above the age displayed to you when you order the digital content. If we determine that you did not comply with these age requirements, we may disable your access to the digital content and we will not refund the amounts paid for the digital content.\\\\n\\\\n5. Additional Provisions\\\\n\\\\n5.1. Functionality may change or be limited. We work constantly to improve MPT Products and respond to changing needs of our community. As part of this continual improvement, we may introduce new features or services, impose limits on, change, suspend, disable, remove, replace, update, upgrade, roll back, or restrict access to features, services, software, content or any part of MPT Products (including Meta Products or Meta Company Products). If a feature, service, software or content is no longer available, or if a technical error occurs, information, data, or content created or provided by you in connection with such feature, service, software or content may be deleted or become inaccessible, and you should not exclusively rely on any feature, service, software or content to store or preserve such information, data or content. In addition, certain features, services, software or content may be disabled or made available in modified form based on your age or location. We may offer free trials or other limited versions of the MPT Products so that you can preview these products before purchase. These versions may have limited features, restrict the permitted time of use and contain other limitations. The features, functionality, or availability of a Third-Party Service may change or be discontinued, including if the developer of such Third-Party Service violates our terms or policies, or in accordance with the Terms or the applicable Third-Party Terms.\\\\n\\\\n5.3. Updates to these Supplemental Terms. These Supplemental Terms may be updated from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices, to promote a safe and secure experience on the MPT Products, and/or comply with applicable law. Unless the changes are required by law, we will notify you before we make changes to these Supplemental Terms or any Commercial Terms (if the changes are applicable to the MPT Products used by you), and give you an opportunity to review the updated terms before they go into effect. We hope that you will continue using MPT Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Supplemental Terms, you must cease use of MPT Products. Your continued use of MPT Products after the effective date of the updated Supplemental Terms constitutes your acceptance of those terms.\\\\n\\\\n5.4. Third-Party Fees and Costs. You are responsible for the fees, costs, and other charges, such as internet usage or utilities fees, associated with use of MPT Products, as well as fees, costs, and other charges associated with Third-Party Services.\\\\n\\\\n5.5. Disclaimers; Limitations of Liability; Indemnification.\\\\n\\\\n5.5.b. Unless a separate limited warranty is provided, certain hardware products of the MPT Products are covered by the Limited Warranty offered by Meta Platforms Technologies, LLC. Nothing in these Supplemental Terms is intended to either abridge or expand the scope of those limited warranties.\\\\n\\\\n5.5.c. Certain MPT Products may have communication or calling capabilities. However, there are important differences between such MPT Products and a mobile or fixed-line telephone service. MPT Products do not provide access to emergency services or emergency service providers (including the police, fire departments, or hospitals), or otherwise connect to public safety answering points. You should ensure you can contact your relevant emergency service providers through a mobile telephone, fixed-line telephone, or other service.\\\\n\\\\n5.5.d. THERE ARE IMPORTANT HEALTH AND SAFETY WARNINGS, INFORMATION, AND INSTRUCTIONS (“HEALTH AND SAFETY WARNINGS”) THAT YOU MUST READ BEFORE USING MPT PRODUCTS OR ALLOWING YOUR CHILD TO USE MPT PRODUCTS, AVAILABLE HERE. THESE INCLUDE WARNINGS, INFORMATION, AND INSTRUCTIONS THAT A PARENT OR GUARDIAN MUST REVIEW AND CONSIDER BEFORE DETERMINING THAT THEIR CHILD IS READY FOR MPT PRODUCTS AND SETTING UP AN ACCOUNT ON THEIR BEHALF. WARNING: FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE HEALTH AND SAFETY WARNINGS AND INSTRUCTIONS MAY RESULT IN DAMAGE TO MPT PRODUCTS OR ACCESSORIES, AND MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, DISCOMFORT OR OTHER POTENTIAL HAZARDS. BY USING MPT PRODUCTS, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE REVIEWED THESE WARNINGS AND INSTRUCTIONS AND ENSURE THAT ALL USERS OF YOUR MPT PRODUCTS READ AND UNDERSTAND THE HEALTH AND SAFETY WARNINGS AND INSTRUCTIONS (AND WILL REVIEW ANY UPDATES THERETO), AND WILL ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH WARNINGS AND INSTRUCTIONS.\\\\n\\\\n5.5.e. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold harmless Meta and its affiliates from and against all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your purchase or use of the MPT Products; (ii) your actual or alleged breach of these Supplemental Terms or any other applicable terms, policies, warnings or instructions provided by Meta or a third party in relation to the MPT Products; (iii) your violation of any applicable law or any rights of any third party; (iv) any content you provide, upload, or transmit while using MPT Products, or (v) any access to or use of MPT Products by any third party to whom you have made available MPT Products access or use. In the event that you provide Meta’s defense to such a claim, you agree that Meta (a) shall be consulted regarding, and shall have the right to approve (at our sole discretion), defense strategy, any appeal, and any settlement of the claim, (b) shall have the right to select defense counsel, and (c) may further participate in the defense of the claim with counsel of our own choice at our own expense.\\\\n\\\\n5.6. Dispute Resolution.\\\\n\\\\nPLEASE READ THIS SECTION 5.6 CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT. THIS SECTION 5.6 REQUIRES YOU TO SUBMIT TO BINDING ARBITRATION ANY AND ALL DISPUTES (EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR BELOW) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS, OR ANY PERSONAL USE OF MPT PRODUCTS, AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.a. What claims must be arbitrated. Except as provided below, you and Meta agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or dispute between you and Meta arising out of or related to these Supplemental Terms, or the purchase or personal use of MPT Products (“claim(s)”) must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. By agreeing to arbitrate, you and Meta expressly waive the rights to sue in court and trial by jury. Our past, present, and future affiliates and agents, as well as any of our successors and assigns, can invoke our rights under this agreement in the event they become involved in a dispute.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.b. What claims won’t be arbitrated. Instead of using arbitration, you or Meta can bring claims in your local “small claims” court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don’t bring your claims in small claims court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. In addition, only a court may decide claims to enforce your or Meta’s intellectual property rights (like copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets) or resolve issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision or whether subsection 5.6.c (requiring individual arbitration), subsection 5.6.d (requiring pre-arbitration notice of disputes), or subsection 5.6.f (regarding coordinated arbitrations) have been violated. Moreover, nothing in these Terms will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief from us on your behalf.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.c. Arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and class arbitrations are not permitted; for example, you may bring a claim only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other users of MPT Products. Nor may an arbitrator consolidate arbitrations unless all parties agree. If there is a final judicial determination that the limitations of this paragraph are unenforceable as to a particular claim or a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief), then that claim or request for relief will be decided by a court after all other claims and requests for relief are arbitrated.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.d. Notice of claims before arbitration. Before you or Meta commence arbitration of a claim, the claimant must provide the other party with a written Notice of Dispute that includes your username, the claimant’s name and contact information, a detailed description of the dispute, the specific relief sought, and the claimant’s signature. If you send the Notice, it also must include your residence address (and mailing address if different), the email address and mobile phone number you use with your account, and if you are represented by an attorney, a signed statement authorizing Meta to discuss your account and share your confidential account information with your attorney. Any Notice of Dispute you send to Meta should be mailed to Meta Platforms, Inc., ATTN: MPT Arbitration Filing, 1 Meta Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025 (“Notice Address”). Before Meta commences arbitration, Meta will send you a Notice of Dispute to the email address you use with your account or when you access MPT Products or by other appropriate means. If you and we are unable to resolve a dispute within 60 days after a fully complete Notice of Dispute is received, you or Meta may commence arbitration, but neither party may commence an arbitration during this 60-day period. If any aspect of the requirements in this subsection have not been met, a court can enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations. In addition, unless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration provider cannot accept or administer the arbitration, nor assess any fees for such an arbitration. If the arbitration already is pending, it must be dismissed.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.e. How arbitration works. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by this arbitration provision. The AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules are available at https://www.adr.org or by writing to the Notice Address. If the AAA cannot or will not administer the arbitration in accordance with this arbitration provision, another arbitration provider will be selected by the parties or, if there is no agreement, by the court. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, unless the arbitrator determines that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel. The arbitrator may consider rulings in other arbitrations involving other claimants, but an arbitrator’s ruling will not be binding in proceedings involving different claimants. Except as provided in subsection 18.3, the arbitrator can award the same relief that a court can award under applicable law, including sanctions against any represented party or counsel permitted under the AAA rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), or other applicable federal or state law.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.e.1. Costs of arbitration. Meta will pay all AAA or arbitrator fees for any arbitration Meta brings. If you are assessed any such fees for any arbitration you bring, we will pay those fees on your behalf, so long as you have fully complied with subsections 5.6.c, 5.6.d, and 5.6.g and your claims seek relief valued at less than $75,000. In all cases, the arbitrator may reallocate these fees in accordance with the AAA’s rules regarding frivolous or improper claims or vexatious litigation.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.f. Arbitration of coordinated claims. If 25 or more claimants submit similar Notices of Dispute or file similar arbitrations and are represented by the same or coordinated counsel (regardless of whether the cases are pursued simultaneously), all of the cases must be resolved in arbitration in staged proceedings. You agree to this process even though it might delay the arbitration of your claim. In the first stage, claimants’ counsel and Meta will each select up to 25 cases (50 cases total) to be filed in arbitration and resolved individually by separate arbitrators. If feasible, arbitrators will be from the respective claimants’ home states.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"As stated in the Meta Terms of Service, we don’t sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don’t share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission.\\\",\\n      \\\"source\\\": \\\"web\\\",\\n      \\\"price\\\": 0.0015,\\n      \\\"length\\\": 24990,\\n      \\\"image_url\\\": {},\\n      \\\"relevance_score\\\": 0.8150897883604115,\\n      \\\"data_type\\\": \\\"unstructured\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Meta Platforms Technologies Products Commercial Terms | Meta Store\\\",\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.meta.com/legal/quest/commercial-terms/?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\\\",\\n      \\\"content\\\": \\\"Meta Platforms Technologies Products Commercial Terms\\\\n\\\\nIf you are an individual engaged in any commercial use of a MPT Product, you represent and warrant that you are not doing so as an individual consumer.

Nothing in these MPT Commercial Terms or the Supplemental Terms is intended to either abridge or expand the scope of that Limited Warranty. NOTE: YOUR COMMERCIAL USE OF META PLATFORMS TECHNOLOGIES PRODUCTS DOES NOT PROVIDE YOU ENTERPRISE-LEVEL WARRANTY AND SUPPORT SERVICES, WHICH MAY OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE FOR EXISTING META VR PRODUCTS OR MPT PRODUCTS.To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold harmless Meta and its affiliates, its and their independent contractors and service providers, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, “Meta Parties”), from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or in any way connected with (a) your purchase or use of, or inability to use, the MPT Products, (b) your violation of any applicable law or any rights of any third party, (c) any actual or alleged breach by you (or by any third party to whom you made available access or use of the MPT Products) of the Terms or any other applicable terms, policies, warnings, or instructions provided by Meta or a third party in relation to the MPT Products, (d) any use of a MPT Product in violation of applicable law, or any distribution, transfer, or export of a MPT Product, by you and any other user of the MPT Products, (e) any content you provide, upload, or transmit via Meta Products, and (f) any access to or use of the MPT Products by any third party to whom you have made available access or use of the MPT Products.

This provision does not cover any commercial claims relating to (i) violations of your or our intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, copyright infringement, patent infringement, trademark infringement, violations of the Brand Usage Guidelines, violations of your or our confidential information or trade secrets, or (ii) efforts to interfere with MPT Products or engage with MPT Products in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). If a Commercial Claim between you and Meta is not subject to arbitration, you and Meta agree that such claim must be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County, and that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that Meta, in its sole discretion, may bring any claim it has against you related to efforts to abuse, interfere, or engage with MPT Products in unauthorized ways in any competent court in the jurisdiction in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the claim.We and you agree that, by entering into this arbitration provision, all parties are waiving their respective rights to a trial by jury or to participate in a class or representative action. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING COMMERCIAL CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING. For example, you may bring a Commercial Claim only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other parties. If there is a final judicial determination that any particular Commercial Claim (or a request for particular relief) cannot be arbitrated according to the limitations of this Section, then only that Commercial Claim (or only that request for relief) may be severed and brought in court. All other Commercial Claims (or requests for relief) will remain subject to this Section. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. All issues are for an arbitrator to decide, except that only a court may decide issues relating to the scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision or the interpretation of the prohibition of class and representative actions. If any party intends to seek arbitration of a dispute, that party must provide the other party with notice in writing. This notice of dispute to us must be sent to the following address: Meta Platforms, Inc., 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025. The arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”), as modified by these MPT Commercial Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. If the AAA is unavailable, the parties will agree to another arbitration provider or the court will appoint a substitute. The arbitrator will not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations in which you are not a party. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any evidentiary submissions made in arbitration will be maintained as confidential in the absence of good cause for its disclosure. The arbitrator’s award will be maintained as confidential only to the extent necessary to protect either party’s trade secrets or proprietary business information or to comply with a legal requirement mandating confidentiality. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA Rules, except that we will pay for your filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your Commercial Claim for damages does not exceed USD $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If you do not wish to be bound by this provision (including its waiver of class and representative claims), you must notify us as set forth below within 30 days of the first acceptance date of any version of these MPT Commercial Terms containing an arbitration provision (we note, for clarity, that the date on which you make your first commercial use of a MPT Product pursuant to these MPT Commercial Terms will constitute such acceptance date). Such notice to us must be submitted to the address here: Meta Platforms, Inc., 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025. All Commercial Claims between us, whether subject to arbitration or not, will be governed by California law, excluding California’s conflict of laws rules, except to the extent that California law is contrary to or preempted by U.S. federal law.\\\\n\\\\nThese MPT Commercial Terms may be updated from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices.

The policy is valid from data acquisition and collection by the ONS, and it also extends through the lifecycle up to and including data archiving and data disposal.\\\\n\\\\nThis policy applies to all UK Statistics Authority and ONS employees, including staff on fixed-term, temporary or permanent contract, staff on secondment, students and contractors.\\\\n\\\\nMetadata provide information about other data, including a description of the data. This includes information that provides context to the data (for example, how it was collected), or the coverage of the data (for example, publication date, description and search keywords).\\\\n\\\\nThe ONS needs to hold and manage a comprehensive set of unambiguous metadata relating to the data it manages, in order to understand the data, fully extract the value from the data and employ appropriate security measures to protect the data.\\\\n\\\\nThe ONS Data Strategy specifies data principles for managing data; data policies support the implementation of these principles. This metadata policy aligns with the data principles and underpins the management and governance of metadata in the ONS. The metadata must comply with the data principles.\\\\n\\\\nMetadata provide information about other data and are essential in aiding understanding of the data and ensuring that appropriate security measures are employed to protect the data. Metadata will be defined and centrally maintained for all data held by the ONS from acquisition to dissemination, archiving and disposal.\\\\n\\\\nAll data acquired and collected by the ONS from external and internal sources must be accompanied by metadata. The ONS Metadata Model defines the minimum set of metadata that must accompany all data acquired by the ONS. In practice, captured metadata will go beyond the defined minimum set of metadata. In order to provide a framework for managing metadata, metadata categories have been defined and all metadata will be categorised according to these categories.\\\\n\\\\nONS Information assets held on the Information and Data Asset Register will be assigned a Metadata Owner, in addition to the Information Asset Owner. The Metadata Owner will periodically review the quality of the metadata they own and will initiate corrective action to address any issues found with the accuracy and quality of the metadata.\\\\n\\\\nThe ONS Business Glossary holds definitions for the main terms used within the ONS.

We don't allow apps with misleading, improperly formatted, non-descriptive, irrelevant, excessive, or inappropriate metadata, including but not limited to the app's description, developer name, title, icon, screenshots, and promotional images. Developers must provide a clear and well-written description of their app. We also don't allow unattributed or anonymous user testimonials in the app's description. Your app title, icon, and developer name are particularly helpful for users to find and learn about your app. Don’t use emojis, emoticons, or repeated special characters in these metadata elements. Avoid ALL CAPS unless it is part of your brand name. Misleading symbols in app icons are not allowed, for example: new message dot indicator when there are no new messages and download/install symbols when the app is not related to downloading content. Your app title must be 30 characters or less. Don’t use text or image in the app title, icon, or developer name that indicate store performance or ranking, price or promotional information, or that suggests relations to existing Google Play programs. In addition to the requirements noted here, specific Google Play Developer Policies may require you to provide additional metadata information.\\\\n\\\\n## Examples of common violations\\\\n\\\\n① Unattributed or Anonymous User testimonials ② Data comparison of apps or brands ③ Word blocks and vertical/horizontal word lists\\\\n\\\\n① ALL CAPS although not part of brand name ② Special character sequences that are irrelevant to the app ③ Use of emojis, emoticons(including kaomojis), and special characters ④ Misleading symbol ⑤ Misleading text\\\\n\\\\n- Images or text that indicate store performance or ranking, such as 'App of the year,' '#1,' 'Best of Play 20XX,' 'Popular,' award icons, etc. - Images or text that indicate price and promotional information, such as '10% off,' '$50 cash back,' 'free for limited time only,' etc. - Images or text that indicate Google Play programs, such as 'Editor’s choice,' 'New,' etc.\\\\n\\\\n#### Here are some examples of inappropriate text, images, or videos within your listing:\\\\n\\\\n- Imagery or videos with sexually suggestive content. Avoid suggestive imagery containing breasts, buttocks, genitalia, or other fetishized anatomy or content, whether illustrated or real. - Using profane, vulgar, or other language that is inappropriate for a general audience in your app’s Store listing. - Graphic violence prominently depicted in app icons, promotional images, or videos. - Depictions of the illicit usage of drugs. Even EDSA (Educational, Documentary, Scientific, or Artistic) content must be suitable for all audiences within the store listing.\\\\n\\\\n#### Here are a few best practices:\\\\n\\\\n- Highlight what's great about your app. Share interesting and exciting facts about your app to help users understand what makes your app special. - Make sure that your app’s title and description accurately describe your app’s functionality. - Avoid using repetitive or unrelated keywords or references. - Keep your app’s description succinct and straightforward. Shorter descriptions tend to result in a better user experience, especially on devices with smaller displays. Excessive length, detail, improper formatting, or repetition can result in a violation of this policy. - Remember that your listing should be suitable for a general audience.

People from whom you collect content or information must explicitly consent to your use of their data. You must clearly explain that you (and not Meta) are collecting this data.\\\\n\\\\nIn order to be compliant, your policy must be up-to-date, understandable, unambiguous, and easily accessible. Also, it has to:\\\\n\\\\n- describe the personal data collected and the purposes of their collection; - accurately list all the third parties the data is shared with; and - inform users of their rights in relation to their data.\\\\n\\\\nSee this privacy policy created with [our generator](https://www.iubenda.com/en/privacy-and-cookie-policy-generator) for an example of how these elements come together.

Meta Ireland will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the processing in accordance with Article 32 GDPR.\\\\n\\\\n### Joint controllership\\\\n\\\\nThe processing of personal data for Page Insights might be subject to the joint controllership arrangement: basically, if you’re a Facebook Page admin, both you and Meta are responsible for complying with the [GDPR](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/5428) in relation to Meta’s Page Insights service.\\\\n\\\\nIn any case, there is **no need to add a joint controller statement**, since Meta takes care of this aspect:\\\\n\\\\n> Meta Ireland will make the essence of this Page Insights Addendum available to data subjects (Article 26(2) GDPR). This is currently done via the Information about Page Insights data which can be accessed from all Pages.\\\\n\\\\n### Facebook Page Insights Controller Addendum Requests\\\\n\\\\nIf you need assistance with regard to a request in accordance with the Page Insights Controller Addendum, you can [submit this form](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/308592359910928):\\\\n\\\\nIn fact, on the Page Insights Controller Addendum Meta says:\\\\n\\\\n> If data subjects exercise their rights under the GDPR with regard to the processing of Insights data against you (Article 26(3) GDPR), or you are contacted by a supervisory authority with regard to the processing of Insights data, each a “request”, you will forward all relevant information regarding such requests to us promptly but within a maximum of seven calendar days.

This is especially true if you use tools that connect your websites, apps, and marketing activities to Facebook.\\\\n\\\\n- What data Facebook collects\\\\n\\\\n- How Meta uses it\\\\n\\\\n- What steps you need to take to meet your legal obligations and be transparent with your customers\\\\n\\\\nIf your business decides how and why personal data is collected or used, then under many global privacy laws you are accountable starting from the moment you collect it, and even after it’s shared with third parties like Meta.\\\\n\\\\nUnderstanding what data Facebook collects and how Meta uses that data matters for several other reasons, detailed below.\\\\n\\\\n### Regulatory compliance\\\\n\\\\nMeta must use the data you share in a way that meets regulatory requirements. Data privacy laws generally protect data belonging to individuals located in the law’s region of jurisdiction — like many countries under the European Union, a single country like Canada, or a US state.\\\\n\\\\nYou may be required to comply with several laws, depending on where your audience or customers are located, and what industry your business is in. Some of the most common global privacy laws are:\\\\n\\\\n- The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\\\\n\\\\n- Multiple US state-level data privacy laws, including, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)\\\\n\\\\n- Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (LGPD)\\\\n\\\\n- South Africa’s Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA)\\\\n\\\\n- Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)\\\\n\\\\n### Customer expectations\\\\n\\\\nAccording to data from Salesforce, 71 percent of customers are increasingly protective of their personal information. That growing caution makes it more important than ever for businesses to be clear about who has access to users’ personal data and how it’s used.\\\\n\\\\nIf your practices aren’t transparent — or if users feel misled — it can erode trust and harm your reputation.\\\\n\\\\n### Business impact\\\\n\\\\nFacebook’s data policies influence how effective your ads and analytics will be. Understanding what data Facebook uses and how it processes that data helps you make better decisions about targeting, measurement, and spend.\\\\n\\\\n### Evolving regulations\\\\n\\\\nNewer laws like the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) restrict how Meta can combine and use EU users’ data collected from one product — like Facebook — across its ecosystem. Meta has multiple platforms and billions of users, so this is a notable restriction on the data and revenue potential in their operations.\\\\n\\\\nThese changes affect how your business can use Meta tools for audience insights, cross-platform tracking, and personalized advertising in the EU. That means ongoing awareness is necessary for continued compliance.\\\\n\\\\n## Understanding Facebook’s data privacy policies and practices\\\\n\\\\nFacebook processes large volumes of personal data that’s collected from both users and businesses that use Meta Business Tools on their websites and apps.\\\\n\\\\nIn some regions, Facebook may also use data collected from other Meta platforms — such as Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp — depending on local privacy laws and user consent.\\\\n\\\\nHere’s a look at what data Facebook collects and how it’s used.\\\\n\\\\n### What data does Facebook collect?\\\\n\\\\n- User-provided information: Includes details that users enter when creating an account or making a purchase, such as their email address, phone number, age, profile photo, and payment or delivery information if they use Meta Pay or checkout features.\\\\n\\\\n- User activity: Facebook tracks what users click, post, like, and share, as well as who they message and otherwise interact with. Engagement with both ads and organic content is tracked.\\\\n\\\\n- App, browser, and device information: Facebook collectsdata from users’ phones, computers, or tablets, including: Device type Operating system Battery level Signal strength IP address App version Network GPS location Photos and camera access\\\\n\\\\n- Device type\\\\n\\\\n- Operating system\\\\n\\\\n- Battery level\\\\n\\\\n- Signal strength\\\\n\\\\n- IP address\\\\n\\\\n- App version\\\\n\\\\n- Network\\\\n\\\\n- GPS location\\\\n\\\\n- Photos and camera access\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to this user data, Facebook receives personal data from the businesses that use its tools.\\\\n\\\\nIf your business integrates Meta Business Tools — such as the Facebook Pixel, SDK, or Conversions API — that means you’re actively sending data about your website or app visitors to Meta. This may include pages viewed, purchases completed, or in-app events triggered by users.\\\\n\\\\n### How do Facebook and Meta use this information?\\\\n\\\\n#### Personalization (including ads)\\\\n\\\\n#### Product improvement\\\\n\\\\nMeta applies user activity information to enhance existing products and develop new features. It also uses device information, such as what’s happening in the background when a Meta app crashes.\\\\n\\\\n#### Safety and security\\\\n\\\\nMeta uses this information to detect and prevent suspicious activity, harmful behavior, spam, and fraud, aiming to keep the platform safe for users and businesses.\\\\n\\\\n#### Measurement and analytics\\\\n\\\\nMeta provides businesses with analytics and reports on ad performance and user engagement. It often uses data shared by businesses through Business Tools.\\\\n\\\\n### Role of cookies and tracking technologies\\\\n\\\\nMeta uses cookies, pixels, and other tracking technologies to collect personal data for a range of uses, including analytics and ad targeting.\\\\n\\\\nFacebook uses these tools to gather information from people who have Facebook accounts, use other Meta products and platforms, or visit third-party websites and apps that integrate Meta Products, such as the “like” or “share” buttons.\\\\n\\\\nImportantly, these tracking technologies can collect data from a person even if they aren’t logged into a Facebook account or don’t have a Facebook account at all (except for users in the European Region).\\\\n\\\\nWhen your business adds Meta Business Tools to your website, app, or online store, Meta can set and read cookies. Meta can then collect information about any visitor, not just Facebook users.\\\\n\\\\nThat means Meta builds advertising and analytics profiles using data from both its users and individuals who don’t use its platforms.\\\\n\\\\nMeta maintains a separate cookies policy that outlines its use of these tracking technologies. If your business receives traffic from visitors in regions with explicit consent requirements — which is an ever-increasing percentage of the world — it’s particularly important to review Meta’s cookies policy carefully.\\\\n\\\\nYou’ll need to implement consent mechanisms that meet legal standards and update your own privacy notices to reflect Meta’s tracking activities on your site.\\\\n\\\\nUnsure about what type of consent you need? Learn the differences between opt-in and opt-out consent and which type you need under different global privacy laws.\\\\n\\\\n### Who does Meta share personal data with?\\\\n\\\\nMeta shares personal data with some third parties for a variety of purposes.\\\\n\\\\nWhile the company states it doesn’t sell personal information, this kind of sharing can legally qualify as a “sale” of personal information under laws like the CCPA/CPRA, even when no money is exchanged.\\\\n\\\\nThe third parties Meta shares data with include the following:\\\\n\\\\n- Advertisers: Businesses that advertise on Meta’s platforms\\\\n\\\\n- Commerce and service partners: Businesses that offer goods or services on Facebook or other Meta products and platforms, as well as any providers acting on their behalf (for example, a payment processor)\\\\n\\\\n- Vendors and service providers: Third-party services that Meta uses to promote its own products, conduct research and surveys, deliver customer service, facilitate payments, analyze product usage, and investigate suspicious activity, among other things\\\\n\\\\n- Academic and public interest researchers: External researchers who focus on topics like safety, technology, or social impact\\\\n\\\\nBoth the data shared and who it’s shared with may vary based on how your business uses Meta Business Tools and what privacy choices users make.\\\\n\\\\n### International data transfers\\\\n\\\\nMeta transfers personal data across borders as part of its global operations. This includes sending data to countries where:\\\\n\\\\n- It has infrastructure, such as the United States, Ireland, Denmark, and Sweden, among others\\\\n\\\\n- Meta products are available\\\\n\\\\n- Its partners, vendors, service providers, and other third parties are located\\\\n\\\\nTo carry out these international data transfers in compliance with applicable privacy laws, Meta relies on legal mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and adequacy decisions.\\\\n\\\\nFor data transfers from the EU to the US, Meta states that, as of September 7, 2023, it relies on the EU-US Data Privacy Framework.\\\\n\\\\n### Sensitive information restrictions\\\\n\\\\nMeta prohibits businesses and partners from sharing certain types of sensitive information through its platform and tools.\\\\n\\\\nThis information includes, but is not limited to:\\\\n\\\\n- Health or medical data\\\\n\\\\n- Detailed financial data\\\\n\\\\n- Government ID numbers\\\\n\\\\n- GPS location data\\\\n\\\\n- Social Security numbers or local equivalents\\\\n\\\\n- Passwords\\\\n\\\\n- Any information that the sharer knows — or reasonably should know — is from or about a child under the age of 13\\\\n\\\\nIf Meta determines that a business may be violating these terms, it reserves the right to take action against that business.\\\\n\\\\n## How to align your business with privacy laws and Facebook privacy requirements\\\\n\\\\nWhile understanding Meta’s data practices is important, you must also be aware of your business’s direct responsibilities when handling user data in connection with Facebook, Meta Business Tools, and Meta products.\\\\n\\\\nBelow are the primary obligations you need to follow.\\\\n\\\\n### Meet EU consent standards under the GDPR and the DMA\\\\n\\\\nIf your business operates in the EU or targets users there, the Digital Markets Act (DMA) also requires Meta to obtain explicit user consent before combining personal data collected on your website with account information from Facebook or other Meta platforms for analytics or targeting.\\\\n\\\\nTo stay compliant, your consent banner or consent management platform (CMP) must clearly inform users of this data use and enable them to opt in.\\\\n\\\\nMonitor Facebook’s updates in the EU to make sure your consent collection practices align with both Facebook’s expectations and DMA requirements.\\\\n\\\\n### Follow data minimization principles\\\\n\\\\nWhen collecting personal data, practice data minimization by gathering only what you need. This helps you to comply with the GDPR and avoid sharing data that may be prohibited or unnecessary for your stated purpose.\\\\n\\\\n### Understand US opt-out requirements\\\\n\\\\nUS states that have implemented data privacy laws to date use an opt-out consent model. In most cases, prior consent for data collection and processing is not required, including for profiling or advertising. It is only necessary to enable users to opt out.\\\\n\\\\nMeta provides a Limited Data Use (LDU) parameter to help businesses comply. When enabled, Meta will limit how it processes the user’s data in line with the applicable state law, if that user had opted out.\\\\n\\\\nThe CCPA/CPRA includes an additional obligation that provides California residents the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal data for profiling or targeted advertising. Businesses must honor this right by prominently displaying a “Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Information” button or link.\\\\n\\\\nMany businesses choose to add this to their cookie banner, website footer, or app menu. You must also immediately stop sharing users’ data with Meta or other third parties when they exercise their right to opt out.\\\\n\\\\n### Follow purpose limitation principles\\\\n\\\\n### Protect the data you handle\\\\n\\\\nYour business is responsible for protecting any personal data it collects, processes, or shares, even after it has been shared with Meta. Data privacy laws like the GDPR and the CCPA/CPRA require businesses to implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to safeguard personal information.\\\\n\\\\nThese security obligations apply across the full data lifecycle — from collection to sharing. Any data processing agreement (DPA) you enter into with Meta should require Meta to apply the same security standards you use as a data controller.\\\\n\\\\nIf your business receives personal data from Meta, you’re responsible for protecting it just as you would any data you collect directly from users.\\\\n\\\\n### Be transparent with your users\\\\n\\\\nBelow is a non-exhaustive checklist of information the policy must include regarding your relationship with Meta.\\\\n\\\\n- Explain that you use Meta Business Tools, such as Facebook Pixel or Conversions API.\\\\n\\\\n- State your reasons for collecting and sharing data with Meta. For example, it may be used for ad targeting, analytics, or campaign measurement.\\\\n\\\\n- Disclose your use of Meta-related cookies and how users can manage or reject them through your site.\\\\n\\\\n- Inform users that data shared with Meta may be further shared by Meta, including with its partners or vendors.\\\\n\\\\n- Include links to Meta’s privacy and cookies policies.\\\\n\\\\n- Explain users’ rights under relevant laws and how they can exercise them, such as the right to object (under the GDPR) and the right to opt out (under the CCPA/CPRA).\\\\n\\\\n- If you use Meta ads for behavioral targeting, provide California users the option to opt out through a “Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Information” link.\\\\n\\\\n- If you rely on Facebook Page Insights, EU regulators treat you and Meta as joint data controllers. You should include a link to Facebook’s Page Controller Addendum and document this arrangement in your records of processing activities.\\\\n\\\\nMeta also requires that when you collect information from people who interact with your page, group, or event, you must first provide them with clear notice. Users must explicitly consent to your use of their data, and you must clearly explain that you, not Meta, are collecting and processing this information.\\\\n\\\\n### Take additional precautions when handling minors’ data\\\\n\\\\nMeta limits ad targeting for users under 18 to age and location only. Your business cannot circumvent these restrictions. For example, you must not use custom audiences based on lists known to include minors.\\\\n\\\\nIf your website or app is likely to attract minors, or if you collect data that could reasonably belong to users under 18, your business may be subject to heightened legal obligations. These requirements vary based on where your users are located and the nature of the data collected.\\\\n\\\\nThey include:\\\\n\\\\n- Obtaining verifiable parental consent under laws like the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the US, which must be separately obtained for collecting data and for sharing data\\\\n\\\\n- Obtaining explicit consent from a parent or legal guardian for minors under the age of 16, per GDPR requirements. EU member states can lower this to age 13\\\\n\\\\n- Using age verification mechanisms when age plays a role in data collection or eligibility for your services\\\\n\\\\nYour business must be prepared to meet these requirements if your data collection practices could involve users under the age of 18.\\\\n\\\\nUsercentrics does not provide legal advice, and information is provided for educational purposes only.

For a deeper look at how Facebook’s GDPR obligations apply to businesses, read this guide.\\\\n\\\\n### How does Facebook use data?\\\\n\\\\nFacebook uses the data it collects to:\\\\n\\\\n- Personalize content and deliver targeted advertising\\\\n\\\\n- Improve and develop new features across Meta products and platforms\\\\n\\\\n- Detect and prevent suspicious or harmful activity\\\\n\\\\n- Provide businesses with analytics and ad performance reporting\\\\n\\\\n### What should businesses know about Facebook’s data sharing practices?\\\\n\\\\nMeta shares personal data with several third parties, including:\\\\n\\\\n- Advertisers, for targeting and measurement\\\\n\\\\n- Commerce and service partners, such as businesses selling through Meta platforms\\\\n\\\\n- Vendors and service providers, for activities on Meta’s behalf, like research, payments, and customer service\\\\n\\\\n- Academic and public interest researchers\\\\n\\\\nKeep in mind that while Meta states that it doesn’t sell personal information, this sharing can still legally qualify as a “sale” under laws like the CCPA/CPRA. The specific data shared and recipients vary based on business activities and user privacy choices.\\\\n\\\\n### What are the key risks and compliance considerations for advertisers?\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisers must be aware of their obligations when using Meta Business Tools:\\\\n\\\\n- You must have a legal basis (often consent) before collecting or sharing data from users in the EU/EEA\\\\n\\\\n- You must stop sharing data when a user opts out under laws like the CCPA/CPRA\\\\n\\\\n- You are responsible for protecting any personal data you collect or receive from Meta\\\\n\\\\n- You cannot target minors using restricted data or circumvent Meta’s ad limitations\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Facebook’s privacy policy governs what happens to the personal data you share: how the platform uses it and how it shares the data with Meta’s other products and platforms, as well as with advertisers and partners.\\\",\\n      \\\"source\\\": \\\"web\\\",\\n      \\\"price\\\": 0.0015,\\n      \\\"length\\\": 17776,\\n      \\\"image_url\\\": {\\n        \\\"0\\\": \\\"https://usercentrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/uc_some_1200x630_facebook_priv_policy.jpg\\\",\\n        \\\"1\\\": \\\"https://usercentrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Celestine-Bahr.png\\\",\\n        \\\"2\\\": \\\"https://usercentrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ISO_IEC-27001_2022-1-1.png\\\"\\n      },\\n      \\\"relevance_score\\\": 0.8697141526603699,\\n      \\\"data_type\\\": \\\"unstructured\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"How to Add a Privacy Policy to Your Facebook Page - TermsFeed\\\",\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/facebook-page-privacy-policy/?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\\\",\\n      \\\"content\\\": \\\"Written by\\\\n\\\\nRobert Bateman\\\\n\\\\nPost-graduate law degree, CIPP/E from the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP).

Summary\\\\n\\\\nHere are some activities that might qualify as \\\\\\\"collecting personal information\\\\\\\":\\\\n\\\\n- Recording the names or email addresses of your customers\\\\n\\\\n- Taking payments via a payment processor such as PayPal or Stripe\\\\n\\\\n- Using Facebook's Page Insights product\\\\n\\\\n- European Union: The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) places very strict data protection requirements on all businesses.\\\\n\\\\n- United Kingdom: EU privacy law still applies in the UK, so if you have UK customers you must also comply with the GDPR\\\\n\\\\nTake a look at this section of Facebook's Pages, Groups and Events Policies:\\\\n\\\\n### Your Contact Details\\\\n\\\\nYou should include full contact details for your business, including its legal name, business address, and email address.\\\\n\\\\nHere's an example from Product Hunt:\\\\n\\\\nNote that Product Hunt refers to itself as \\\\\\\"the Controller.\\\\\\\" This is only relevant if you have customers in the EU and have to comply with the GDPR. We'll discuss this in more detail below.\\\\n\\\\n### Personal Information You Collect\\\\n\\\\nWhether you're running a physical store, an ecommerce store, or online services business, you'll need to collect basic personal information such as customers' names and contact details.\\\\n\\\\nHere's an example from Bando:\\\\n\\\\nIf you have a broader online presence extending beyond your Facebook Page, you'll also need to explain the other ways in which you collect personal information.\\\\n\\\\nHere's an example from Microsoft:\\\\n\\\\n### How You Use Personal Information\\\\n\\\\nYou must explain your purposes for collecting personal information, i.e. how you use it.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, you can use your Facebook Page to enable customers to book appointments or make orders. Or you might use Facebook Messenger to engage with customers and receive inquiries.\\\\n\\\\nYou should have a clear business purpose for using any personal information you collect. If you collect email addresses, names, and shipping addresses, you must explain why you do this.\\\\n\\\\nHere's an example from catering business Chrissie Cakes and Supplies:\\\\n\\\\n### How You Share Personal Information\\\\n\\\\nHere's an example from ecommerce business Jasmin Studio Crafts:\\\\n\\\\nNote that you don't necessarily need to name the businesses with whom you share personal information: you can just identify the types of businesses.\\\\n\\\\n## If You Have Customers In the UK or EU\\\\n\\\\nIf you've ever visited a company's Facebook Page from within the UK or the EU (or the wider European Economic Area), you might have noticed a link reading \\\\\\\"Information about Page Insights data.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nClicking this link leads to a page explaining that Facebook and Facebook Page Admins are \\\\\\\"joint controllers\\\\\\\" under the GDPR.\\\\n\\\\nA German court required Facebook to create this policy based on how its \\\\\\\"Insights\\\\\\\" product works. Here's where to find Insights:\\\\n\\\\nThe Insights tool automatically collects data about who visits your Page. As a Page Admin, you would never be able to actually use this data to determine whether a particular individual had visited your page.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, according to the EU, this data is personal information. And under the GDPR, you and Facebook are jointly responsible for processing it.\\\\n\\\\n### Your Obligations Under Facebook's Page Insights Controller Addendum\\\\n\\\\nAs a Facebook Page Admin, you're held jointly responsible for Insights data. Facebook's Page Insights Controller Addendum sets the rules about how you and Facebook should meet your legal obligations.\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR allows joint controllers to decide among themselves how they will fulfill their legal obligations. Fortunately, Facebook has allocated almost all of the GDPR's duties to itself, and there's not much left for Page Admins to do.\\\\n\\\\nHere are Page Admins' duties under the Addendum:\\\\n\\\\n- Your legal basis for processing Page Insights data and the \\\\\\\"legitimate interests\\\\\\\" you are pursuing by using this data\\\\n\\\\n- The identity of your responsible data controller and their contact details\\\\n\\\\n- The identity of your Data Protection Officer (if you have one)\\\\n\\\\nFacebook doesn't explain what any of this means or how you can communicate it to your customers. That's where we come in.\\\\n\\\\n### Your Legal Basis and Legitimate Interests\\\\n\\\\nFacebook requires you to identify your legal basis for processing Page Insights data.\\\\n\\\\nThe concept of the \\\\\\\"legal basis\\\\\\\" (or \\\\\\\"lawful basis\\\\\\\") is very important under the GDPR.\\\\n\\\\nWe won't go into detail about the legal bases here. Essentially, there are six legal bases, and every time you collect personal information, you need to identify a legal basis for doing so.\\\\n\\\\nSo, what's your legal basis for receiving personal information from Page Insights? Well, Facebook suggests that it might be in your \\\\\\\"legitimate interests,\\\\\\\" which is one of the six legal bases.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\"Legitimate interests\\\\\\\" can be a suitable legal basis when you process personal information in a way that benefits your business without causing any significant privacy risks. You should carry out a Legitimate Interests Assessment if you plan on relying on this legal basis.\\\\n\\\\nHere's an example of a clause that addresses this:\\\\n\\\\nThe clause explains how Insights works and then identifies its legitimate interests in receiving Insights data: the ability to recognize user preferences and locations and to adapt and improve its offer accordingly.\\\\n\\\\n### Responsible Data Controller and Data Protection Officer\\\\n\\\\nFacebook requires that you provide a name and contact details for the \\\\\\\"responsible data controller.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe responsible data controller is your company. Your company is a data controller under the GDPR because it decides why and how to process personal information.\\\\n\\\\nFacebook also requires that you provide contact details for your Data Protection Officer. However, unless your business has over 250 employees, or it regularly processes sensitive personal information, it's unlikely you'll need to appoint a Data Protection Officer.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, go to your Facebook Page dashboard and select \\\\\\\"Edit Page Info\\\\\\\" in the top right-hand corner.\\\\n\\\\n## Summary\\\\n\\\\n- Who you are, and how your customers can contact you\\\\n\\\\n- What personal information you collect\\\\n\\\\n- How you use personal information\\\\n\\\\n- How you share personal information\\\\n\\\\nIf you have customers in the UK or EU, you also need to comply with Facebook's Page Insights Joint Controller Addendum.\\\\n\\\\nStay compliant with our agreements, policies, and consent banners — everything you need, all in one place.\\\\n\\\\nDisclaimer\\\\n\\\\nThis article is not a substitute for professional legal advice.

Facebook has specific rules on how it splits GDPR responsibilities with Page administrators.\\\\n\\\\n- 1. GDPR Basics\\\\n\\\\n- 2. GDPR Controllers and Processors\\\\n\\\\n- 3.

Summary\\\\n\\\\n## GDPR Basics\\\\n\\\\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Union regulation, meaning it has legal effect in every country that's a member of the EU.\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR applies to any personal data processing if:\\\\n\\\\n- The business that processes the data (or decides how it's processed) is in an EU country\\\\n\\\\n- The data subject (the person the data is about) is in an EU country, or\\\\n\\\\n- The data processing physically takes place in an EU country\\\\n\\\\n(Note that although the United Kingdom is no longer an EU country, it is currently scheduled to follow EU Regulations until the end of 2020. After that the same measures will still apply in the UK through domestic law until this law is revoked, amended or replaced.)\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR sets out a wide range of rules about personal data processing. The fundamentals are that:\\\\n\\\\n- It's only legal to process personal data in a limited range of circumstances, most commonly that the data subject has given meaningful consent or the processing is necessary for your legitimate interests.\\\\n\\\\n- Processing means any use of data, including collection and disclosure.\\\\n\\\\n- You must tell the data subject, in advance, the purpose or purposes for which you will process data.\\\\n\\\\n- You must inform the data subject again (and get fresh consent if appropriate) before processing the data for a new purpose.\\\\n\\\\n- The data subject has the right to know what data you store about them and whether you've disclosed it to a third party. They also have the right to correct errors and, in some circumstances, ask you to delete data.\\\\n\\\\n- You must adequately secure the data.\\\\n\\\\n## GDPR Controllers and Processors\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR holds two groups responsible for data processing.\\\\n\\\\n- Controllers decide what data is collected and how it is processed. They may also carry out the processing.\\\\n\\\\n- Processors carry out processing following the instructions of controllers.\\\\n\\\\nIn simple terms, both controllers and processors are responsible for complying with the GDPR, while controllers are also responsible for making sure processors working for them are complying with the GDPR.\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR also allows for the situation where two different controllers make decisions about processing the same data. As long as the same data is processed for the same purpose, the two are considered joint controllers.\\\\n\\\\nThis has important legal consequences. Ultimately both joint controllers are individually responsible for all the processing and could be individually responsible for paying compensation after a breach. However, the GDPR does allow the joint controllers to set out who will be in charge of complying with which specific GDPR requirements. This includes who will take responsibility for dealing with any complaints or any communication with regulators (known under the GDPR as supervisory authorities).\\\\n\\\\n## Facebook Page Insights and Personal Data\\\\n\\\\nFor the most part the data processing and GDPR situation with Facebook is simple. When individuals post on their own account or in groups, it is Facebook that is collecting and processing data and thus Facebook that is classed as the controller whenever that processing comes under the GDPR.\\\\n\\\\nThe situation is more complicated with Pages. These work in a similar way to a personal profile but cover an organization, business or brand. Rather than users becoming \\\\\\\"friends,\\\\\\\" users choose to \\\\\\\"like\\\\\\\" a page and can then see updates from it. Each Page is set up by a Facebook user who then acts as its administrator.\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR element comes into play because the administrator is able to access information about people who interact with the page. This information comes through a service called Page Insights which uses cookies to collect data about page interactions and users.\\\\n\\\\nThat created a legal argument that the Page administrator could be classed as a data controller because their decision to create the Page contributed to data being collected and processed.\\\\n\\\\nAs Facebook is also clearly a data controller in this context, it's down to Facebook and the Page administrator to determine whether they have joint controller status and how this will operate.\\\\n\\\\n## Page Insights Controller Addendum\\\\n\\\\nThe joint controller set-up is covered by the Page Insights Controller Addendum, which is part of Facebook's Pages, Groups and Events Policies. By creating a Page, you agree to this addendum and its position on joint controllers. In this context, \\\\\\\"Facebook\\\\\\\" means Facebook Ireland Limited.\\\\n\\\\nThe key points are as follows:\\\\n\\\\n- Facebook and the Page administrator are joint controllers in the case of data collected through Page events (that is, interactions with the Page) and then aggregated to provide it to the administrator through Page Insights.\\\\n\\\\n- The Page administrator is responsible for having a legal basis to process Insights Data.\\\\n\\\\n- Facebook is responsible for most other aspects of GDPR compliance, specifically: Facebook's own legal basis for processing data Informing data subjects about the collection and processing Handling the data subject's rights such as access, correction and deletion Making any notifications after a data breach\\\\n\\\\n- Facebook's own legal basis for processing data\\\\n\\\\n- Informing data subjects about the collection and processing\\\\n\\\\n- Handling the data subject's rights such as access, correction and deletion\\\\n\\\\n- Making any notifications after a data breach\\\\n\\\\nFacebook decides how to comply with its GDPR obligations.\\\\n\\\\nIf a Page Administrator receives a data access request regarding Page Insights data, they must not respond. Instead they must pass the request on to Facebook within seven days using this form:\\\\n\\\\n### Facebook Requirements\\\\n\\\\n#### Legal Basis\\\\n\\\\nFacebook requires you to tell users what your legal basis is for the collection and processing of data through Page Insights. (Remember that you are jointly responsible for such processing.)\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR sets out six allowable legal bases in Article 6:\\\\n\\\\n- Consent\\\\n\\\\n- Processing necessary to perform a contract\\\\n\\\\n- Processing necessary to comply with a legal obligation\\\\n\\\\n- Processing necessary to protect someone's vital interests\\\\n\\\\n- Processing necessary to carry out a task in the public interest or to exercise official authority\\\\n\\\\n- Processing necessary for the controller's legitimate interests\\\\n\\\\nPage visitors don't get enough information or give specific meaningful consent to make basis 1 suitable in most cases involving Page Insights. Bases 2 through 5 will rarely if ever apply to Page Insights.\\\\n\\\\nThis leaves basis 6, legitimate interests. For this basis to apply, you must go through a three point checklist:\\\\n\\\\n- What exactly is the legitimate interest?\\\\n\\\\n- Is the processing necessary to achieve this interest?\\\\n\\\\n- Do the individual's personal data rights and freedoms override this interest?\\\\n\\\\nNormally your access to Page Insights should meet these tests and thus legitimate interests is an acceptable legal basis.\\\\n\\\\nUsing Page Insights helps you learn more about your audience and thus improve and target the service and information you provide. The fact you can only access the information in aggregated form means it doesn't pose a serious risk or breach of privacy for an individual.\\\\n\\\\nRomantic Germany goes beyond simply stating it relies on \\\\\\\"legitimate interests\\\\\\\" and instead explains to users what this means:\\\\n\\\\n#### Joint Controller Statement\\\\n\\\\nLufthansa does this in a policy dedicated to its Facebook Page:\\\\n\\\\nBASF gives additional detail on what data is processed through Page Insights, listing specifics like your country of location, number of visits, gender relations, etc.:\\\\n\\\\n### GDPR Requirements\\\\n\\\\n- Your identity and contact details that of your data protection officer (if you have one)\\\\n\\\\n- What data you process\\\\n\\\\n- The purpose for processing\\\\n\\\\n- The legal basis for processing\\\\n\\\\n- How long you'll keep the data\\\\n\\\\n- Whether you share the data with anyone else\\\\n\\\\n- The user's rights to access data, correct it, and ask you to delete it\\\\n\\\\nGood Game Studios puts this information directly after the details of the Page Insights data processing:\\\\n\\\\n- Answer a few questions about your business:\\\\n\\\\n- Enter the country and click on the \\\\\\\"Next Step\\\\\\\" button:\\\\n\\\\nThe second is to make sure your identity and contact details are clearly listed in the About section of your Page. To avoid confusion, do so through the standard About field rather than posting it elsewhere on the Page, for example as a pinned post:\\\\n\\\\n## Summary\\\\n\\\\nLet's recap what you need to know and do to comply with the joint controller rules for Facebook Page Insights:\\\\n\\\\n- The GDPR applies if a data controller, a data subject, or the processing itself is in an EU country.\\\\n\\\\n- When the GDPR applies, the data controller must give the data subject details of what data is processed, how and why. They must have a legal basis to process the data.\\\\n\\\\n- A data controller is the person or organization that decides what data to process and how to do so. The GDPR allows for joint controllers of particular data. They share legal responsibility but can divide compliance tasks between them.\\\\n\\\\n- Facebook collects data about interactions with Pages and makes this data available to Page administrators through the Page Insight program.\\\\n\\\\n- Facebook's terms - which Page administrators must agree to - say that Facebook and the Page administrator are joint controllers for the Page Insight data.\\\\n\\\\n- Facebook agrees to handle most of the GDPR compliance tasks relating to the Page Insight data. It requires the Page administrator to take responsibility for having a legal basis for the data's processing. In most cases this will be \\\\\\\"legitimate interests.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n- Page users can make data access requests to the Page administrator, but the Page administrator must pass this on to Facebook within seven days. Facebook will handle the request.\\\\n\\\\n- Add their full contact details\\\\n\\\\n### About this article\\\\n\\\\nLast updated\\\\n\\\\nThis article was last updated on 01 July 2022.\\\\n\\\\nAuthor\\\\n\\\\nJohn Lister\\\\n\\\\nFreePrivacyPolicy Legal writer\\\\n\\\\nCategory\\\\n\\\\nDisclaimer\\\\n\\\\nPlease note that legal information, including legal templates and legal policies, is not legal advice.\\\\n\\\\n### Try out our free generators\\\\n\\\\nFree Cookie Consent\\\\n\\\\nFree Terms and Conditions Generator\\\\n\\\\nFree Cookies Policy Generator\\\\n\\\\nFree Disclaimer Generator\\\\n\\\\nFree EULA Generator\\\\n\\\\nFree Return & Refund Policy Generator\\\\n\\\\n### What our customers says\\\\n\\\\n— Anonymous\\\\n\\\\n— Andrea - Toronto Success Coach\\\\n\\\\nQuick and easy way to secure our company website.

But previously, when you employed third-party apps such as a web-based program to view your Instagram feed, you may have unwittingly agreed to make your photo content visible in search engines. Ad data shared with partners has demographic details in it, but it does not have personally identifying details.\\\\n\\\\nIf you choose to delete your Instagram account, your posts will vanish, but data shared by others isn’t considered part of your account.

There's lots of information in our Data Policy about the kinds of information we collect, with some examples and links to where you can learn more. But here are some of the categories of things we receive: the content you provide when you post, like or comment, your connections, your transactions, and your usage of our products. We also collect information that other people provide about you, like when they tag you in a photo. We also collect information from your device, such as identifiers, cookies, and information you can control using your device settings, including your camera, microphone and different kinds of location information, along with information from our partners, like websites you visit, apps you use or purchases you make.\\\\n\\\\nSharing Your Data\\\\n\\\\nData allows us to provide a personalized experience to different people, and to learn new things and improve our service. There's lots of information in our Data Policy about the ways we use the information we have, with some examples and links to where you can learn more. But here are some of the ways we use data:\\\\n\\\\n- People and accounts on Instagram, depending on the audience you choose, your settings, and the features you use. Remember that public information can be seen by anyone.\\\\n\\\\n- Services (like apps and websites) you choose to give access to your Instagram information, like if you use a service to see all your social media together. You can revoke their access to your information, here.\\\\n\\\\n- Advertisers. We help advertisers understand whether their ads are effective. We also share with companies that help to make reports for advertisers.\\\\n\\\\n- Companies that offer things through Instagram, like if you buy something and provide your shipping address.\\\\n\\\\n- Vendors and service providers we hire to help us with our business.\\\\n\\\\n- Researchers and academics, like to try to understand how to stop bullying and harassment online.\\\\n\\\\n- Legal requests (like from a court or law enforcement), when consistent with the law and our policies.\\\\n\\\\nHow To Access and Download Your Data\\\\n\\\\nA great first step to controlling your online data is to understand what you’ve shared. We offer tools to review the information we have for your account and the data you’ve shared on Instagram. You’ll see information we have about you, as well as your content, like your posts, comments, and messages. Learn how to use these tools in our Help Center.\\\\n\\\\nHow to Delete Your Data\\\\n\\\\nSometimes people change their minds about things they’ve shared online. To delete a photo or video that you've posted, tap above your post and then tap Delete. You can also archive posts to hide them from your profile and make it so your followers and other people on Instagram can't see it. But don’t worry—when you archive a post, it keeps all its likes and comments.\\\\n\\\\nYou can also temporarily disable or delete your account at any time. When you delete your account, we delete your posts, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Learn more.\\\\n\\\\nAnything that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted if you delete your account. But, if you are concerned about a picture or information someone else has posted about you, you can report it to us.

It stipulates that all tech providers will use data solely for the specific purpose outlined by the client.\\\\n\\\\nTech providers are also subject to rules regarding client information, data sharing with clients, and client termination.\\\\n\\\\n### Prohibited Practices Regarding Data Use\\\\n\\\\nSome of the prohibited uses include:\\\\n\\\\n- Processing platform data to discriminate or encourage discrimination against others\\\\n\\\\n- Processing platform data to make eligibility determinations about people (like housing, employment, or education opportunities)\\\\n\\\\n- Processing platform data to perform or facilitate surveillance\\\\n\\\\n- Selling, licensing, or purchasing the data\\\\n\\\\n- Placing the data on a search engine or making it otherwise available\\\\n\\\\n- Decoding, circumventing, re-identifying, de-anonymising, or unscrambling the data in any way\\\\n\\\\n- Changing the functionality of your app or data processing so users view it as an unfamiliar or different app\\\\n\\\\n- Processing friends list from Facebook (also owned by Meta) to establish social connections in your platform, unless each person grants you access for that purpose\\\\n\\\\nTheir policy outlines additional restrictions regarding who you share the data with and your data retention, deletion, and accessibility options for consumers granted those rights by data privacy laws and regulations.\\\\n\\\\nThese laws impact businesses worldwide, and some have very broad thresholds, so chances are at least one applies to your business.\\\\n\\\\nWhile each piece of legislation is different, you’ll need to include the following information:\\\\n\\\\n- What personal data you collect\\\\n\\\\n- Why you collect the information\\\\n\\\\n- How you use it (aka, your legal basis)\\\\n\\\\n- Who you share it with or sell it to\\\\n\\\\n- What rights your users have over that data\\\\n\\\\n- How they can follow through on those rights\\\\n\\\\n- California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which amends some areas of the CCPA\\\\n\\\\n- California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)\\\\n\\\\n- Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA)\\\\n\\\\n- Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)\\\\n\\\\n#### Introduction\\\\n\\\\nIn this section, you introduce your business, explain who the terms of the policy apply to, and write clear definitions of phrases used throughout the agreement so your users’ expectations are properly set.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, this is where you would want to include your business’s physical address and even its complete legal entity name(s).\\\\n\\\\nSee an image of their introductory clause below.\\\\n\\\\n#### What Personal Data You Collect\\\\n\\\\nIn this section, list the categories of personal data you collect and process about your users, including any sensitive personal information.\\\\n\\\\nBe thorough and specific in this section to meet the Instagram Platform Terms and any additional legal requirements.\\\\n\\\\nAdobe has an excellent example of this clause, shown in the screenshot below.\\\\n\\\\n#### Why You Collect the Data and How it Gets Used\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re subject to laws like the GDPR or the CCPA, you must say why you collect the data and include your legal basis.\\\\n\\\\n#### Who You Share the Data With\\\\n\\\\nThis way, your users can read those third-party agreements and decide if they’re comfortable giving those entities access to their information.\\\\n\\\\nBelow, see how Adobe formats this clause in their privacy agreement.\\\\n\\\\n#### Internet Cookies\\\\n\\\\nUnder laws like the GDPR and CCPA, internet cookies qualify as personal data, plus most of these regulations give users the right to limit how their information gets used regarding analytics and advertising.\\\\n\\\\nAdobe includes a short paragraph with live links to their other policies, shown below.\\\\n\\\\n#### The Legal Rights of Your Consumers\\\\n\\\\nYou must list all rights your users have over their data if you’re subject to laws like the GDPR, CCPA, or the Virginia CDPA.\\\\n\\\\nYou can do this in one clause or separate it into policies specific to users in those unique areas.\\\\n\\\\n#### Information Regarding Children’s Data\\\\n\\\\nIf your services target children, you must follow additional requirements to process their information, like obtaining consent from their legal guardians.\\\\n\\\\n#### International Data Transfers\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR outlines specific guidelines regarding international data transfers.\\\\n\\\\nSome countries are approved for transfers because they follow the same safety standards mandated by the regulation.\\\\n\\\\nBut if you transfer to other places, including the US, you must ensure the third party signs an agreement stating they’ll abide by all the obligations, user rights, and data protocols required by the GDPR.\\\\n\\\\nBelow, read how Adobe phrases this clause in its policy.\\\\n\\\\n#### Safety and Security\\\\n\\\\nAdobe puts a short paragraph in its policy to meet this legal requirement, as shown below.\\\\n\\\\n- Use a managed solution\\\\n\\\\n- Try a free template\\\\n\\\\n- Do

Or, if you use Termly, we’ll provide the URL for you. Either option works for both Instagram and legal compliance.\\\\n\\\\nBut by enforceable, I really mean compliant. Privacy policies are descriptions of your privacy collection practices intended to inform your users; it’s not a set of rules or directions your users must follow.\\\\n\\\\n- Ask them to select an unmarked checkbox to express that they’ve read and agreed to it\\\\n\\\\nThis second method is known as the browsewrap method or implied consent.\\\\n\\\\n## Summary\\\\n\\\\nInstagram privacy policies are required for any app or website that uses their API, even those that don’t collect personal data.\\\\n\\\\nThese policies must cover a variety of requirements, including what’s included in Meta’s Platform Terms and any laws or regulations that impact your business.\\\\n\\\\n##### More about the author\\\\n\\\\n#### Written by Stefani Schmidt, M.S., CIPM, CIPP-US\\\\n\\\\n- Termly vs Ketch: Comparing Features and Services Comparisons November 14, 2025Ali Talip Pınarbaşı, CIPP/E, & LLM\\\\n\\\\n##### Termly vs Ketch: Comparing Features and Services\\\\n\\\\nNovember 14, 2025Ali Talip Pınarbaşı, CIPP/E, & LLM\\\\n\\\\nNovember 7, 2025Hanna De La Garza\\\\n\\\\n- 5 Types of Legal Requirements for Ecommerce Stores Articles November 5, 2025Natasha Piirainen\\\\n\\\\n##### 5 Types of Legal Requirements for Ecommerce Stores\\\\n\\\\nNovember 5, 2025Natasha Piirainen\\\\n\\\\n- 14 Website Policies You Need and How To Make Them Articles October 15, 2025Hanna De La Garza\\\\n\\\\n##### 14 Website Policies You Need and How To Make Them\\\\n\\\\nOctober 15, 2025Hanna De La Garza\\\\n\\\\nOctober 15, 2025Natasha Piirainen\\\\n\\\\n- 5 Best GDPR WordPress Plugins for GDPR Compliance Articles October 15, 2025Natasha Piirainen\\\\n\\\\n##### 5 Best GDPR WordPress Plugins for GDPR Compliance\\\\n\\\\n- Clickwrap vs. Browsewrap Agreements and When To Use Them Articles October 15, 2025Natasha Piirainen\\\\n\\\\n##### Clickwrap vs. Browsewrap Agreements and When To Use Them\\\\n\\\\n- Do Not Track Disclosures Articles October 15, 2025Natasha Piirainen\\\\n\\\\n##### Do Not Track Disclosures\\\\n\\\\nExplore more resources\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Their policy outlines additional restrictions regarding who you share the data with and your data retention, deletion, and accessibility options for consumers granted those rights by data privacy laws and regulations.

Every photo. Every voice message. Fed into AI,\\\\\\\" the post read.\\\\n\\\\nThe claim was also spread on [Threads](https://www.threads.com/@hustlewithchip/post/DQscX-SAQJc) ([archived](https://archive.ph/PpDTq)) and prompted Snopes readers to search the site for the truth of it.\\\\n\\\\nMeta's planned privacy policy update on Dec. 16, 2025, does not pertain to direct messages and does not change how Meta handles them, though. The update instead will focus on how it uses data collected from conversations people have with Meta AI, the company's generative artificial intelligence (AI) app. We therefore rate this claim as false.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\"The update mentioned in the viral rumor isn't about DMs at all, it's about how we'll use people's interactions with our AI features to further personalize their experience,\\\\\\\" a Meta spokesperson told Snopes over email. \\\\\\\"We do not use the content of your private messages with friends and family to train our AIs unless you or someone in the chat chooses to share those messages with our AIs. This also isn't new, nor is it part of this Dec. 16 privacy policy update.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nOn Oct. 1, 2025, [Meta revealed](https://about.fb.com/news/2025/10/improving-your-recommendations-apps-ai-meta/) that it planned to update its privacy policy on Dec. 16. The incoming major change to the company's privacy policy, according to the news release, was that Meta would start using peoples' interactions with its generative AI features to personalize content and ad recommendations.\\\\n\\\\nFollowing the announcement, Meta kept both its [current privacy policy](https://archive.ph/nLWj7), last updated in June 2025, and its [upcoming privacy policy](https://archive.ph/BDgxu#1) on its website.\\\\n\\\\nIn both [current](https://archive.ph/nLWj7#selection-479.0-483.39:~:text=Messages%20you%20send%20and%20receive%2C%20including%20their%20content%2C%20subject%20to%20applicable%20law.%20On%20some%20Products%2C%20you%20can%20use%20end%2Dto%2Dend%20encrypted%20messages.%20Learn%20more%20about%20how%20end%2Dto%2Dend%20encryption%20works.) and [new](https://archive.ph/BDgxu#selection-475.0-479.39:~:text=Messages%20that%20you%20send%20and%20receive%2C%20including%20their%20content%2C%20subject%20to%20applicable%20law.%20On%20some%20Products%2C%20you%20can%20use%20end%2Dto%2Dend%20encrypted%20messages.%20Learn%20more%20about%20how%20end%2Dto%2Dend%20encryption%20works.) privacy policies, the section on that data Meta collects included the same passage about messages:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\"Messages that you send and receive, including their content, subject to applicable law. On some Products, you can use end-to-end encrypted messages.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAccording to [Meta's policies](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/1084673321594605), end-to-end encrypted messages cannot be read by Meta: \\\\\\\"End-to-end encrypted messages and calls ensure only you and the people you're communicating with can see or listen to what is sent, and no one else, not even Meta, can do so.\\\\\\\" Despite this policy, people can choose to [store encrypted messages remotely with Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/820525008940780) and Meta may read encrypted messages if one of the people in the conversation [reports a message](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/498828660322839?cms_platform=android-app&helpref=platform_switcher). When someone reports an encrypted message, recent messages from that conversation are forwarded and sent to Meta for review, according to the company's policies.\\\\n\\\\nAt the time Meta launched default encrypted messages on Messenger in December 2023, the company [wrote](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/12/default-end-to-end-encryption-on-messenger/#:~:text=nobody%2C%20including%20Meta%2C%20can%20see%20what%E2%80%99s%20sent%20or%20said%2C%20unless%20you%20choose%20to%20report%20a%20message), \\\\\\\"nobody, including Meta, can see what's sent or said, unless you choose to report a message.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nNot all messaging systems on Meta's platforms are encrypted. While Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp conversations are set to be encrypted by default, chats with Facebook groups, chats with businesses and Marketplace chats are [not encrypted](https://archive.ph/ulJzQ). According to Meta policy, the company may collect that data.\\\\n\\\\n#### Sources\\\\n\\\\nCrisan, Loredana. \\\\\\\"Launching Default End-To-End Encryption on Messenger.\\\\\\\" Meta, 7 Dec. 2023, about.fb.com/news/2023/12/default-end-to-end-encryption-on-messenger/.

Usually, they’re incredibly difficult to read. Research, [polling](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/), [reporting](https://themarkup.org/the-breakdown/2023/08/03/how-to-quickly-get-to-the-important-truth-inside-any-privacy-policy), and personal experiences [abound](https://iacis.org/iis/2022/2_iis_2022_138-149.pdf) on why privacy policies are so [bad](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/05/31/abolish-privacy-policies/) these days: [they are too long](https://lorrie.cranor.org/pubs/readingPolicyCost-authorDraft.pdf), [use legalistic and inaccessible terminology](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/12/opinion/facebook-google-privacy-policies.html), [are presented as take-it-or-leave-it](https://kb.osu.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/ff3341dc-dd6f-5fdf-920c-245521837c05/content), and [much more](https://kb.osu.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/d6692cd5-a08e-534e-9350-735fb279bce4/content). None of this is new information (although, it’s all still a serious and widespread problem).\\\\n\\\\nBut less attention is often paid to how privacy policies themselves are *displayed.*As someone who has spent a substantial amount of time reviewing these policies across countless companies and platforms, in my work researching commercial data practices, I’ve come to regard one company as perhaps the worst of the lot in how it visually presents its policies: Meta. Regulators and lawmakers should take note.\\\\n\\\\n## How did it get this way?\\\\n\\\\nThe 20-year-old, US-based multinational conglomerate founded by Mark Zuckerberg has [over three billion](https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2024/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2023-Results-Initiates-Quarterly-Dividend/default.aspx) daily active users worldwide and operates products and services ranging from Facebook and Instagram to WhatsApp, Oculus, and AI models such as Llama. Yet, understanding what the company is collecting, inferring, and purchasing, let alone doing with individuals’ data, is made even more challenging by the way Meta incomprehensibly lays out its privacy policy language.\\\\n\\\\nIt is, to say the least, a test to think of any company besides Meta that puts so much effort into breaking up its privacy policies into probably hundreds of indigestible pieces, scattered across numerous websites and pages, with confusing hyperlinks, circular references to documents, no ability to comprehensively and functionally search across documents, and misleading or inaccurate statements about what specific pages describe to the viewer. In other words: it’s a usability disaster.\\\\n\\\\nSearching “Meta privacy policy” online brings up a [page on Facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/) titled “What is the Privacy Policy and what does it cover?” It’s remarkably long. It’s broken up into many subsections. It’s difficult to search. It’s hard to navigate. And, at the time of this writing, that webpage alone had 168 links to various other webpages and pop-ups within the page.\\\\n\\\\nIf you click on just one of those, such as “[Review the privacy policies of the other Meta companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678),” it brings you to a page called “[The Meta Companies](https://web.archive.org/web/20241008070028/https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678)” which then links to terms for Meta Payments, Facebook Payments International, and more. When I clicked on the [EU privacy terms for Facebook Payments Limited International](https://web.archive.org/web/20240927014044/https://www.facebook.com/payments_terms/EU_privacy), it directed me to a page with no information on it that prompted me to log into a Facebook.com account. One page claims to tell you something useful and points to many other pages and popups, which also tell you you’ll get the information you want—if you just click one more hyperlink. It’s turtles all the way down.\\\\n\\\\nDesigning privacy information in this way makes it nearly impossible for the average user to understand what Meta does with respect to a specific product, service, or technology. Looking to learn what information is [collected and transmitted](https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/06/16/facebook-is-receiving-sensitive-medical-information-from-hospital-websites) via the Meta Pixel? If you’re hoping for a quick read, good luck. Meta breaks its Pixel documentation into numerous pages, and when you click on a link on the Pixel [Advanced Matching page](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel/advanced/advanced-matching) that claims to help you “learn what data is sent when using the Meta Pixel,” it directs you to the [general page](https://transparency.meta.com) for Meta’s Transparency Center. Now, we’re back where we started above, with numerous subsections and 168 links and pop-ups. Only by pulling together information from [many](https://web.archive.org/web/20241006044549/https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel/) [different](https://web.archive.org/web/20241003134755/https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel/implementation/conversion-tracking#custom-events) webpages is it possible for a user to even *see* all the information Meta posts about what data the Meta Pixel can transmit. (That’s before attempting to understand it.)\\\\n\\\\nTake another example. Maybe you’re concerned about Meta [saying](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/meta-will-start-collecting-anonymized-data-about-quest-headset-usage/) in February 2024 it would begin collecting what it called “anonymized” device usage data about Oculus headsets—at the same time as Meta [ended](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/4503393-meta-set-to-delete-all-oculus-account-data-by-end-of-march/) consumers’ ability to use an Oculus Quest headset without creating a Meta account or linking it to an existing one. Well, learning about that topic is a nightmare, too. The webpage for “[Legal Documents](https://web.archive.org/web/20240926134919/https://www.meta.com/legal/quest/)” about Quest devices links to dozens of different webpages, including a variety of “supplemental” policies and documents, that themselves have many links and subsections, again perpetuating the same design and layout problem. It would take hours just to pull together the information, before any work on consolidation and interpretation.\\\\n\\\\nMeta didn’t always display its privacy information this way. But over the years, the company (once eponymously known for its first product, Facebook) has presented its privacy policy in an [increasingly graphics-oriented format](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/13/facebook-updates-privacy-policy-data), riddled with drop-downs and buttons. The substance of that evolving set of privacy policies, as [pointed out](https://archive.epic.org/2014/12/facebook-revises-privacy-polic.html) by nonprofit groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center, has made clear the company has continued to collect and use individuals’ data without meaningful consent. Yet, the days when users could use a little CTRL+F or CMD+F magic to search for words within a page are in the rearview mirror. Meta’s design and display decisions have made answering basic questions—such as “what data does Meta gather via virtual reality headsets?” or “from which apps and services does Meta collect fine-grained geolocation data?”—virtually impossible for the average user. You can’t even attempt to understand what you can’t easily access in the first place. Given how much effort this confusing design must take, that might be Meta’s very objective.\\\\n\\\\n## It’s worse by comparison\\\\n\\\\nTo be very clear, Meta is hardly the only problematic actor when it comes to privacy policies. As described above, privacy policies are rife with length, complexity, and other issues. Many companies drown their privacy policies in words like “could,” “might,” or “may,” and while it might make for fun semantic debate in a law class, these hypotheticals don’t tell readers what companies are *actually doing* with data. They also intentionally leave the door open to companies doing anything they want with individuals’ data tomorrow or five years from now.\\\\n\\\\n#### Our Content delivered to your inbox.\\\\n\\\\nJoin our newsletter on issues and ideas at the intersection of tech & democracy\\\\n\\\\n#### Thank you!\\\\n\\\\nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list.\\\\n\\\\nThe privacy policy for Google, for example, is not the most accessible document in the world and [contains](https://iacis.org/iis/2022/2_iis_2022_138-149.pdf) many such hypothetical statements and privacy loopholes. It also has lots of vague language. But Meta stands out even from its data-hoarding competitors like Google and TikTok in just how badly it presents its “privacy policy” information—and just how difficult it is, should you have a specific question about a specific service or product, to find concrete information about what Meta does with your data.\\\\n\\\\n## Where are the regulators?\\\\n\\\\nAt a certain point, there should be consequences for designing the layout and presentation of privacy policies in completely unreasonably segmented, obfuscating ways. Perhaps it’s worth an inquiry into whether such practices violate the US [Federal Trade Commission Act](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/statutes/federal-trade-commission-act) and similar prohibitions on deceptive business practices. Legislators should prevent these bad practices in future privacy laws, too.\\\\n\\\\nThe FTC, for its part, has been clear in its [enforcement decisions](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/D%26O-InMarketMediaLLC.pdf) that companies should seek “affirmative express consent” from consumers before collecting and using their data. Doing so requires “clear and conspicuous disclosure” to consumers of the categories of data collected about them; the purposes of data collection, use, and disclosure; “a simple, descriptive URL (or hyperlink if technically possible) to a document that describes” this information; and “a simple, descriptive URL (or hyperlink if technically possible) to a simple, easily-located means by which the consumer can withdraw consent and that describes any limitations on the consumer’s ability to withdraw consent.” Otherwise, companies may be in violation of [Section 5 of the FTC Act](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/mission/enforcement-authority)—and its prohibition on unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\\\\n\\\\nMeta does not appear to clearly and conspicuously describe the data it collects about individuals. It does not have simple, descriptive URLs for these pages—in fact, any single privacy-related document on a Meta website could link to dozens or over 100 other pages and pop-ups that Meta purports provide additional information. Both of these points raise the question of whether Meta is deviating from practices the FTC has indicated are legally required.\\\\n\\\\nFurther, the FTC Act prevents deceptive practices in general—[defined](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/mission/enforcement-authority) by FTC [policy](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/410531/831014deceptionstmt.pdf) as “involving a material representation, omission, or practice that is likely to mislead a consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances.” If any number of pages on the Meta website that claim to provide consumers with information about privacy do not, in fact, provide and present said information in a reasonable manner (or, really, at all), it likewise raises the question of whether Meta might be violating the FTC Act by deceptively *designing* the layout of its privacy policy information.\\\\n\\\\nLawmakers working on privacy bills should not forget that substance *and* layout are important for privacy policies, to avoid these kinds of bad practices that bury information from consumers and regulators, further limit consumers’ ability to consent, and threaten individuals’ ability to exercise their privacy rights. New laws on privacy should require companies to make their privacy policies clearly laid out, on a single or just a few webpage(s), in an easily navigable and comprehensively searchable format. Regulators should also ask the question of whether certain kinds of presentations of privacy policies violate existing federal and state laws, introducing the need to investigate and potentially enforce compliance.\\\\n\\\\nWe’re long overdue for better laws, regulations, and technology practices for presenting data collection and use information to consumers. But in some cases, the design and presentation of privacy information is itself a serious problem—and Meta might just win the prize for “worst in show.”\\\\n\\\\n#### Related Reading\\\\n\\\\n- [Researchers Consider the Impact of Meta's CrowdTangle Shutdown](https://www.techpolicy.press/researchers-consider-the-impact-of-metas-crowdtangle-shutdown/) - [We Know a Little About Meta’s “Break Glass” Measures.

At Meta, we’ve always set out to build personalized experiences that provide value without compromising your privacy. So, it’s on us to have strong protections for the data we use and be transparent about how we use it. That includes communicating more clearly about our data practices and the choices you have.\\\\n\\\\nWe’re also including more ways to access controls you can use to experience our products in ways that are right for you. You can continue to manage your privacy settings at any time and we’re committed to letting you know if we make important changes to how we collect, use and share your information.\\\\n\\\\n## Responding To Feedback and Evolving Regulation\\\\n\\\\n## Privacy Center\\\\n\\\\nYou can think of Privacy Center as a hub for your privacy questions, where you can learn about how we use data, make use of some of the various privacy controls that we offer, and brush up on key account security tips and tools. We’ll also continue adding more guides and controls to it.\\\\n\\\\n## Updating Controls for Your Privacy\\\\n\\\\nNew Audience Controls: Starting today, we’re also rolling out a new setting to make it easier to manage who sees your posts on Facebook. Now, when someone selects a default audience, that audience selection will apply to new posts created in Facebook that they share to their timeline unless they select a different audience for a particular post. Previously, your default audience for posts matched whichever audience you chose most recently. So if you had just made a post that was available to the public, your subsequent posts would be as well. This new setting will help make sure you’re sharing with the right people in your community.\\\\n\\\\nNew Ways to Manage the Ads You See: Recently, we consolidated the Ad Topics and Interest Categories controls into a single control that can be accessed on Facebook and Instagram, covering a more extensive set of ad topics. This allows people to use a single control to set preferences across ad topics that reflect the interest targeting categories advertisers may use to reach them and the content they might see in an ad.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"We’ve added more detailed explanations in our Privacy Policy including about how we use and share information with third parties. And we’ve paired it with the Privacy Center and new controls to manage your experience, like who sees your posts and the topics you want to see ads about.

We enable you and third parties, like businesses, to communicate and interact with each other using our Services, such as Catalogs for businesses on WhatsApp through which you can browse products and services and place orders. Businesses may send you transaction, appointment, and shipping notifications; product and service updates; and marketing. For example, you may receive flight status information for upcoming travel, a receipt for something you purchased, or a notification when a delivery will be made. Messages you receive from a business could include an offer for something that might interest you.

When you or others use third-party services or other Meta Company Products that are integrated with our Services, those third-party services may receive information about what you or others share with them. For example, if you use a data backup service integrated with our Services (like iCloud or Google Account), they will receive information you share with them, such as your WhatsApp messages. If you interact with a third-party service or another Meta Company Product linked through our Services, such as when you use the in-app player to play content from a third-party platform, information about you, like your IP address and the fact that you are a WhatsApp user, may be provided to such third party or Meta Company Product.

You can choose to share your Status, which is also end-to-end encrypted.\\\\n\\\\n- You may also provide content that is not encrypted which means that we can see it. This includes your profile picture, your \\\\\\\"about\\\\\\\" information and names and descriptions of your communities and groups.\\\\n\\\\n- Your Connections. You can use contact upload and provide us with the phone numbers in your device address book on a regular basis, including those of users of our Services and your other contacts. If any of your contacts aren’t yet using our Services, we’ll manage this information in a way that is designed to ensure that those contacts cannot be identified by us. Learn more about contact upload and about the information we provide to people who do not use WhatsApp here. We also collect information on users who contact you that aren't in your device address book and any users you've blocked or who have blocked you.\\\\n\\\\n- Your Community and Group Information. You can create, join, or get added to communities, groups and broadcast lists, and such communities, groups and lists get associated with your account. You give your groups and communities a name. You can provide a community or group profile picture or description. We also collect information about when communities and groups are created or updated.\\\\n\\\\n- Customer Support Information And Other Communications. When you contact us for customer support or otherwise communicate with us (for example, through optional surveys), you may provide us with information related to your use of our Services, including copies of your messages, any other information you deem helpful in order for us to understand and resolve your query, and how to contact you (e.g., an email address). For example, you may send us an email with information relating to app performance or other issues. We also collect information on how you use our customer support features (e.g., the searches you make on our Help Center), any feedback you give us on the customer support experience and your responses to surveys or questions on a range of topics (including, for example, what you like or don't like about the Service or Meta Companies).\\\\n\\\\n### Automatically Collected Information\\\\n\\\\n- Usage Information.We collect information about your usage of our Services. This includes collecting information about your activity (including how you use our Services), how you interact with others using our Services (including when you search for and interact with a business), and the time, frequency, and duration of your activities. This also includes information about the features you use like our messaging (and integrated applications), calling, Status, communities, groups or business features; whether you are online; timestamps related to your use such as when you last used our Services (your \\\\\\\"last seen\\\\\\\") and the times you send and receive calls and messages; and when you last updated your \\\\\\\"about\\\\\\\" information.\\\\n\\\\n- Log and Troubleshooting Information. We collect information about how our Services are performing when you use them, like service related diagnostic and performance information. This information includes log files, timestamps, diagnostic or crash data, website performance logs and error messages or reports.\\\\n\\\\n- Device And Connection Information. We collect device and connection-specific information when you install, access, or use our Services. This includes information such as hardware model, operating system information, battery level, signal strength, app version, browser information, mobile network, connection information including whether you are using wifi or cellular data, mobile operator or internet service provider (ISP), language and time zone, IP address, device operations information and identifiers (including identifiers unique to Meta Company Products associated with the same device or account).\\\\n\\\\n- General Location Information. Even if you do not choose to use our precise location-related features (see Information Shared by You and by WhatsApp with Third Parties), we use IP addresses and other information like phone number area codes, to estimate your general location (e.g., country).\\\\n\\\\n- Cookies. We collect information using cookies to operate and provide our web-based Services and website. Learn more about how we use cookies to provide you our Services.\\\\n\\\\n- User Choices. We collect information about your in-app settings, privacy settings and records about when you accepted terms. Only you are in control of your privacy settings which can be used to change who can see your \\\\\\\"last seen\\\\\\\", profile photo, \\\\\\\"about\\\\\\\" information, Status updates, read receipts or add you to groups. We also collect information about whether you have enabled push notifications and whether you wish to send disappearing messages.\\\\n\\\\n- Authentication Information. To verify and grant appropriate authorisations as you use the Services (such as when you choose to use encrypted backups and create your unique password), we create and store authentication codes which are a security measure to ensure only you are accessing your account. Authentication Information also includes your public encryption keys that our end-to-end encryption protocol uses. Messages are encrypted before they reach our servers which means that we cannot see them.\\\\n\\\\n### Information Third Parties Provide About You\\\\n\\\\n- Information Others Provide About You. We receive information about you from other users. For example, when other users you know use our Services, they may provide your phone number if they use contact upload just as you may provide theirs. We require each of these users to have lawful rights to collect, use, and share your information before providing any information to us. They may also send you messages, send messages to groups to which you belong, or call you. You should keep in mind that in general any user can capture screenshots of your chats or messages or make recordings of your calls with them and send them to WhatsApp or anyone else, or post them on another platform.\\\\n\\\\n- User Reports. Just as you can report other users, other users or third parties may also choose to report to us your interactions and your messages with them or others on our Services; for example, to report possible violations of our Terms or policies. When a report is submitted to us through the reporting tools, we receive information from the reporter on both the reporting user and those reported. To find out more about the information we receive when a User Report is submitted to us and what happens when a User Report is submitted, please see About blocking and reporting contacts.\\\\n\\\\n- Third-Party Services. WhatsApp receives information about bad actors and abuse from Meta Companies and app verification information from anti-abuse services to promote safety, security and integrity. For example, when Meta becomes aware of a scam encouraging individuals to contact a phone number via WhatsApp, they might share that phone number with WhatsApp so we can investigate the WhatsApp account. We also allow you to use our Services in connection with third-party services and Meta Company Products. If you use our Services with such third-party services or Meta Company Products, we may receive information about you from them; for example, if you use the WhatsApp share button on a news service to share a news article with your WhatsApp contacts, groups, or broadcast lists on our Services. Please note that when you use third-party services or Meta Company Products, the terms and privacy policies of the company that offers those services will govern your use of those services and products.\\\\n\\\\n### Information Shared by You and by WhatsApp with Third Parties\\\\n\\\\nYou share your information as you use and communicate through our Services, and we share your information to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customise and support our Services.\\\\n\\\\n- Send Your Information To Those With Whom You Choose To Communicate. You share User Content when you communicate through our Services. You are in control of what you are sending when you send your information to the individual or business WhatsApp users you choose to communicate with. Please be mindful that, once you have sent User Content to a WhatsApp user, they can store or reshare it with others on and off our Services.\\\\n\\\\n- Third-Party Services. When you, or other users you interact with, use third-party services or other Meta Company Products that are linked through our Services, the providers of those services or products may receive the information about you that you or others share with them. For example, if you use a data backup service integrated with our Services (like iCloud or Google Drive), they will receive the information you share with them, such as your WhatsApp messages, and if you search the web from WhatsApp for a group profile picture, the search engine provider will receive the search term you use. If you interact with a third-party service or other Meta Company Products through our Services, such as when you use the in-app player to play content from a third-party platform like YouTube or Facebook, information like your IP address and technical information showing that the request comes from a WhatsApp app, may be provided to the provider of such service or products. Please note that when you use third-party services or other Meta Company Products, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those services and products.\\\\n\\\\n- Third-Party Service Providers.

They can't hear you yet (allegedly encrypted chats) but they can see everything else: what you eat, where you shop, they browse through your trash, look into the parcels you receive, can see who visits you (their names, addresses, etc), what apps do you use, how much is on your credit card.All this can be profiled, compared to the other millions and enriched with probable other details, e.g. if 100mln others bought a bucket and a shovel, when you buy a bucket you definitely want a shovel too. When 1000 people with the same details as you are criminals, than you are most likely a criminal too.\\\\n\\\\n*Upvotes: 472*\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Read More: WhatsApp Has Shared Your Data With Facebook for Years, Actually ...

DO NOT EDIT. ======================================================\\\\n\\\\nthis file is generated from src/style.less\\\\n\\\\nOpinionThe Privacy Project Google’s 4,000-Word Privacy Policy Is a Secret History of the Internet By Charlie Warzel and Ash Ngu Illustrated by Rose Wong\\\\n\\\\nThe late 1990s was a simpler time for Google. The nascent company was merely a search engine, and Gmail, Android and YouTube were but glimmers in the startup’s eye. Google’s first privacy policy reflected that simplicity. It was short and earnest, a quaint artifact of a different time in Silicon Valley, when Google offered 600 words to explain how it was collecting and using personal information.\\\\n\\\\nThat version of the internet (and Google) is gone. Over the past 20 years, that same privacy policy has been rewritten into a sprawling 4,000-word explanation of the company’s data practices.\\\\n\\\\nThis evolution, across two decades and 30 versions, is the story of the internet’s transformation through the eyes of one of its most crucial entities. The web is now terribly complex, and Google has a privacy policy to match.\\\\n\\\\nGoogle’s Privacy Policy Over Time 1999 Google is sensitive to the privacy concerns of its users. The Internet allows individuals to explore and communicate with unprecedented ease, but it also allows websites to collect and distribute personal information with equal ease. We at Google know that many users are, understandably, concerned about such practices, and we wish to make clear our policy for collecting and using personal information. Google’s Policy Google’s policy on our wholly controlled and operated Internet sites is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. Google does not willfully disclose individually identifiable information about its customers to any third party without first receiving that customer’s permission. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it. Google may share information about users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we only talk about our users in aggregate, not as individuals. For example, we may disclose how frequently the average Google user visits Google, or which other query words are most often used with the query word “Microsoft.” From time to time, there may be situations where Google asks you for personal information. When we intend to use your personal information, we tell you up front. This way you can decide whether you want to give us the information or not. In case you change your mind or some personal information changes, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us. Google and Cookies Upon your first visit to Google, Google sends a “cookie” to your computer. A cookie is a file that identifies you as a unique user. It can also store personal preferences and user data. A cookie can tell us, “This is the same individual who visited Google two days ago” but it cannot tell us, “This person is Joe Smith” or even, “This person lives in the United States.” Google uses cookies to track user trends and patterns, in order to better understand our user base and to improve the quality of our service. Google may also choose to use cookies to store user preferences. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of Google may not function properly if you refuse cookies. Links to Other Sites The page that comes up after “clicking” on a result URL is likely to be outside the Google site and beyond our control. Other links, such as for the Google-friends mailing list archive, are also on sites not controlled by Google. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Google may choose to exhibit its search results in the form of a “URL redirecter.” When a URL redirecter is used, whenever you “click” on a URL from a search result, information about the “click” is sent to Google, which then sends you to the site you clicked on. Google uses this URL information to understand and improve the quality of Google’s search technology. For instance, Google uses this information to determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results. Google’s policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Google’s control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. We reserve the right at our discretion to make changes to this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. 2009 At Google we recognize that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by Google Inc. or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies except DoubleClick (DoubleClick Privacy Policy) and Postini (Postini Privacy Policy); collectively, Google’s “services.” In addition, where more detailed information is needed to explain our privacy practices, we post supplementary privacy notices to describe how particular services process personal information. These notices can be found in the Google Privacy Center. Google adheres to the US Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement, and is registered with the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor Program. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us through our website or write to us at Privacy Matters c/o Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, California, 94043 USA Information we collect and how we use it We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information to us, such as Google Search. In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information: Information you provide – When you sign up for a Google Account or other Google service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password). For certain services, such as our advertising programs, we also request credit card or other payment account information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers. We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other Google services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information. Cookies – When you visit Google, we send one or more cookies – a small file containing a string of characters – to your computer or other device that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, improving search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends, such as how people search. Google also uses cookies in its advertising services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. We may set one or more cookies in your browser when you visit a website, including Google sites that use our advertising cookies, and view or click on an ad supported by Google’s advertising services. Log information – When you access Google services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. User communications – When you send email or other communications to Google, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. Affiliated Google Services on other sites – We offer some of our services on or through other web sites. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to Google in order to deliver the service. We process such information under this Privacy Policy. The affiliated sites through which our services are offered may have different privacy practices and we encourage you to read their privacy policies. Gadgets – Google may make available third party applications through its services. The information collected by Google when you enable a gadget or other application is processed under this Privacy Policy. Information collected by the application or gadget provider is governed by their privacy policies. Location data – Google offers location-enabled services, such as Google Maps for mobile. If you use those services, Google may receive information about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate a location (such as a cell ID). Links – Google may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality of our search technology, customized content and advertising. Read more information about links and redirected URLs. Other sites – This Privacy Policy applies to Google services only. We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as search results, sites that include Google applications, products or services, or links from within our various services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Google only processes personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and/or the supplementary privacy notices for specific services. In addition to the above, such purposes include: Providing our services, including the display of customized content and advertising; Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services; Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; Protecting the rights or property of Google or our users; and Developing new services. You can find more information about how we process personal information by referring to the supplementary privacy notices for particular services. Google processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country. We may process personal information to provide our own services. In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising partners. Choices for personal information When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service privacy notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the supplementary service privacy notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Google features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. Google uses the DoubleClick advertising cookie on AdSense partner sites and certain Google services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. You can view, edit, and manage your ads preferences associated with this cookie by accessing the Ads Preferences Manager. In addition, you may choose to opt out of the DoubleClick cookie at any time by using DoubleClick’s opt-out cookie. You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case Google may not be able to provide those services to you. Information sharing Google only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Google in the following limited circumstances: We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information. We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, its users or the public as required or permitted by law. If Google becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually. Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data. Information security We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. Data integrity Google processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services or as otherwise permitted under this Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary. Accessing and updating personal information When you use Google services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users’ personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services. Enforcement Google regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or Google’s treatment of personal information by contacting us through this web site or by writing to us at Privacy Matters c/o Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, California, 94043 USA When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is Google’s policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Google and an individual. Changes to this Privacy Policy Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). Each version of this Privacy Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and we will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review. If you have any additional questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us any time through this web site or at 2019 When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information. Effective January 22, 2019 | Archived versions | Download PDF We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include: Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads and embedded Google Maps You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used. To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us. INFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls. When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions. When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information. Things you create or provide to us When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services. We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos. Information we collect as you use our services Your apps, browsers & devices We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.

We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request. We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and which apps you've installed. Your activity We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include: Terms you search for Videos you watch Views and interactions with content and ads Voice and audio information when you use audio features Purchase activity People with whom you communicate or share content Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services Chrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account If you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types of calls. You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account. Go to Google Account Your location information We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions for your weekend getaway or showtimes for movies playing near you. Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by: GPS IP address Sensor data from your device Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Google’s Policy Google’s policy on our wholly controlled and operated Internet sites is to respect and protect the privacy of our users.

Our services include:\\\\n\\\\n- Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home\\\\n\\\\n- Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system\\\\n\\\\n- Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps\\\\n\\\\n# Information Google collects\\\\n\\\\n## We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services\\\\n\\\\nWe collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.\\\\n\\\\n## Things you create or provide to us\\\\n\\\\nWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.\\\\n\\\\nWe also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.\\\\n\\\\n## Information we collect as you use our services\\\\n\\\\n### Your apps, browsers & devices\\\\n\\\\nWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.\\\\n\\\\nThe information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.\\\\n\\\\nWe collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you’re using your Android device.\\\\n\\\\n### Your activity\\\\n\\\\nWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:\\\\n\\\\n- Terms you search for\\\\n\\\\n- Videos you watch\\\\n\\\\n- Views and interactions with content and ads\\\\n\\\\n- Voice and audio information\\\\n\\\\n- Purchase activity\\\\n\\\\n- People with whom you communicate or share content\\\\n\\\\n- Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\\\\n\\\\n- Chrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account\\\\n\\\\nIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.\\\\n\\\\nYou can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Google Account\\\\n\\\\n### Your location information\\\\n\\\\nWe collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.\\\\n\\\\nDepending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:\\\\n\\\\n- GPS and other sensor data from your device\\\\n\\\\n- IP address\\\\n\\\\n- Activity on Google services, such as from your searches or places you label like home or work\\\\n\\\\n- Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices\\\\n\\\\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Timeline if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\\\\n\\\\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\\\\n\\\\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\\\\n\\\\n# Why Google collects data\\\\n\\\\n## We use data to build better services\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\\\\n\\\\n### Provide our services\\\\n\\\\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\\\\n\\\\n### Maintain & improve our services\\\\n\\\\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\\\\n\\\\n### Develop new services\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\\\\n\\\\n### Provide personalized services, including content and ads\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\\\\n\\\\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\\\\n\\\\nGo to My Ad Center\\\\n\\\\n### Measure performance\\\\n\\\\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\\\\n\\\\n### Communicate with you\\\\n\\\\n### Protect Google, our users, and the public\\\\n\\\\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\\\\n\\\\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\\\\n\\\\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.\\\\n\\\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\\\\n\\\\n# Your privacy controls\\\\n\\\\n## You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\\\\n\\\\nGo to Privacy Checkup\\\\n\\\\n## Managing, reviewing, and updating your information\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.\\\\n\\\\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:\\\\n\\\\n### Privacy controls\\\\n\\\\n### Activity Controls\\\\n\\\\nDecide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Activity Controls\\\\n\\\\n### Ad settings\\\\n\\\\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. You can modify your interests, choose whether your personal information is used to make ads more relevant to you, and turn on or off certain advertising services.\\\\n\\\\n### About you\\\\n\\\\nManage personal info in your Google Account and control who can see it across Google services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to About You\\\\n\\\\n### Shared endorsements\\\\n\\\\nChoose whether your name and photo appear next to your activity, like reviews and recommendations, that appear in ads.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Shared Endorsements\\\\n\\\\n### Sites and apps that use Google services\\\\n\\\\nManage information that websites and apps using Google services, like Google Analytics, may share with Google when you visit or interact with their services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services\\\\n\\\\n### Ways to review & update your information\\\\n\\\\n### My Activity\\\\n\\\\nMy Activity allows you to review and control data that’s saved to your Google Account when you’re signed in and using Google services, like searches you’ve done or your visits to Google Play. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.\\\\n\\\\nGo to My Activity\\\\n\\\\n### Google Dashboard\\\\n\\\\nGoogle Dashboard allows you to manage information associated with specific products.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Dashboard\\\\n\\\\n### Your personal information\\\\n\\\\nManage your contact information, such as your name, email, and phone number.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Personal Info\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed out, you can manage information associated with your browser or device, including:\\\\n\\\\n- Signed-out search personalization: Choose whether your search activity is used to offer you more relevant results and recommendations.\\\\n\\\\n- YouTube settings: Pause and delete your YouTube Search History and your YouTube Watch History.\\\\n\\\\n- Ad Settings: Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.\\\\n\\\\n## Exporting, removing & deleting your information\\\\n\\\\nYou can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.\\\\n\\\\nExport your data\\\\n\\\\nTo delete your information, you can:\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your content from specific Google services\\\\n\\\\n- Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\\\\n\\\\n- Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your entire Google Account\\\\n\\\\nDelete your information\\\\n\\\\nInactive Account Manager allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account.\\\\n\\\\nAnd finally, you can also request to remove content from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.\\\\n\\\\nThere are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:\\\\n\\\\n- Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a cookie in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.\\\\n\\\\n- Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\\\\n\\\\n# Sharing your information\\\\n\\\\n## When you share your information\\\\n\\\\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.\\\\n\\\\n## When Google shares your information\\\\n\\\\nWe do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:\\\\n\\\\n### With your consent\\\\n\\\\nWe’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.\\\\n\\\\n### With domain administrators\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:\\\\n\\\\n- Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email\\\\n\\\\n- View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install\\\\n\\\\n- Change your account password\\\\n\\\\n- Suspend or terminate your account access\\\\n\\\\n- Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request\\\\n\\\\n- Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings\\\\n\\\\n### For external processing\\\\n\\\\n### For legal reasons\\\\n\\\\nWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\\\\n\\\\n- Respond to any applicable law, regulation,legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.\\\\n\\\\n- Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.\\\\n\\\\n- Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public.\\\\n\\\\nWe may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.\\\\n\\\\n# Keeping your information secure\\\\n\\\\n## We build security into our services to protect your information\\\\n\\\\nAll Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.\\\\n\\\\nWe work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:\\\\n\\\\n- We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit\\\\n\\\\n- We offer a range of security features, like Safe Browsing, Security Checkup, and 2 Step Verification to help you protect your account\\\\n\\\\n- We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems\\\\n\\\\n- We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.\\\\n\\\\n# Exporting & deleting your information\\\\n\\\\nYou can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your content from specific Google services\\\\n\\\\n- Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\\\\n\\\\n- Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your entire Google Account\\\\n\\\\n# Retaining your information\\\\n\\\\nWe retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:\\\\n\\\\n- Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your personal info or the content you create or upload, like photos and documents. You can also delete activity information saved in your account, or choose to have it deleted automatically after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.\\\\n\\\\n- Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as advertising data in server logs.\\\\n\\\\n- We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.\\\\n\\\\n- And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.\\\\n\\\\n# Compliance & cooperation with regulators\\\\n\\\\n## Data transfers\\\\n\\\\nWe maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data.\\\\n\\\\nWhen we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.\\\\n\\\\n## U.S. state law requirements\\\\n\\\\nSome U.S. state privacy laws require specific disclosures.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain the categories of information Google collects and the sources of that information in Information Google collects.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain the purposes for which Google collects and uses information in Why Google collects data.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain when Google may disclose information in Sharing your information. Google does not sell your personal information. Google also does not “share” your personal information as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\\\\n\\\\n- We explain how Google retains information in Retaining your information. You can also learn more about how Google anonymizes data. As described there, when Google anonymizes data to protect your privacy, we maintain policies and technical measures to avoid re-identifying that information.\\\\n\\\\nU.S. state privacy laws also provide the right to request information about how Google collects, uses, and discloses your information. And they give you the right to access your information, sometimes in a portable format; correct your information; and to request that Google delete that information. Many of these laws also provide the right to opt out of certain forms of profiling and targeted advertising.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy.

The first time you turn on Location History — which is off by default — your auto-delete option will be set to 18 months by default. Web & App Activity auto-delete will also default to 18 months for new accounts. This means your activity data will be automatically and continuously deleted after 18 months, rather than kept until you choose to delete it.

If you do not agree to these Terms, then do not access or use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms.”\\\\n\\\\nThe wording here includes a sentence that’s currently buried further down in the terms, making it clear that by using its apps, you are indeed agreeing to these terms.\\\\n\\\\nThe update also includes more specific explanations around misuse of Meta’s apps, and the scraping of data from them.\\\\n\\\\n“You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data you do not have permission to access, regardless of whether such automated access or collection is undertaken while logged-in to a Facebook account.”\\\\n\\\\nThat last sentence has been added, clarifying that you can’t use the fact that you were logged into Facebook as an excuse for data scraping. This distinction, between logged in and logged out access, has been used in the legal defense of some scraping cases.\\\\n\\\\nThere’s also a new explanation about circumventing Meta’s protection measures, and how that’s also a no-no.\\\\n\\\\nMeta’s also included some specific qualifiers on avatar and AI use, based on its separate agreements for each:\\\\n\\\\n“If you use Avatars, then the Avatar Terms also apply. If you use our AI products and features, the Meta AI Terms also apply. To the extent any supplemental terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAs noted, the references to its separate Avatar and Meta AI terms here are new, ensuring that these documents, which already exist, are also specifically noted within the initial user agreement.\\\\n\\\\nMeta’s Avatar and AI terms cover the use of your personal data inputs for these elements, including, say, selfie videos for avatar creation, or the sharing of your conversations with Meta’s AI tools with third parties.\\\\n\\\\nWhy would Meta need to share your AI chats? Well, it might need to pass on your query to Google or Bing to get search results from the web, though the terms also cover any internal reviews of your AI prompts and other usage.\\\\n\\\\nSo there’s a range of things that you’re agreeing to, which are not new, as such, but are now being more explicitly built into Meta’s usage agreements.\\\\n\\\\nOn its Community Standards, Meta’s not actually updating the document, but it is merging its Community Standards that cover Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and Threads into one central location for easier access.\\\\n\\\\nSo if you see this new prompt, now you’ll know what it is you’re agreeing to.\\\\n\\\\n- purchase licensing rights\\\\n\\\\n### Social Media Today news delivered to your inbox\\\\n\\\\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\\\\n\\\\n- Retrieved from Daniel Oberhaus/Wikimedia Commons on April 18, 2022 Tracker The Complete Elon Musk–Twitter Saga For months, we’ve been tracking Elon Musk’s $44 billion deal with Twitter.

But what exactly does that mean? More specifically, by using Facebook, posting on Instagram or writing on Threads, you are granting Meta an open license to use any of your content however they want.\\\\n\\\\n### Additional explanations around misuse of Meta’s apps and data scraping\\\\n\\\\nThis update also explains the misuse of Meta’s apps and the scraping of data from them. In other words, you cannot log into Facebook and use it as an excuse for collecting data.\\\\n\\\\n“You may not access or collect data from our products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data you do not have permission to access, regardless of whether such automated access or collection is undertaken while logged in to a Facebook account.”\\\\n\\\\n### Qualifiers on Avatar and AI use\\\\n\\\\n“If you use Avatar, then the Avatar Terms also apply. If you use our AI products and features, the Meta AI Terms also apply. To the extent any supplemental terms conflict with these terms, the supplemental terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.”\\\\n\\\\nThese terms cover the use of your personal data inputs for these elements. For example, videos for avatar creation or sharing your conversations with Meta’s AI tools with third parties.\\\\n\\\\n### In a “nutt” shell\\\\n\\\\nMcNutt & Partners is a full-service advertising and digital marketing agency.

This publication represents our company’s views on AI and creativity.\\\\n\\\\n--\\\\n\\\\nDid you get an email from the Zuck this morning? I did and if you’re one of the billions still roaming around the social network that defined so much of our modern perspective, you should really read up on the changes.\\\\n\\\\nBut who in the world has time for that? So, my friend ChatPDF and I are here to help. Yes, this is what we at Credtent.org call an AI-Assisted piece of content because I used ChatPDF to help analyze the update and find some bugaboos that might be worth a second look. This is what I often tell people — use AI to help protect yourself against AI.\\\\n\\\\nLet me disclose clearly that I am not an attorney and this is NOT legal advice. It’s just what a read of the TOS changes means from both an AI’s analysis and my own personal take on this coming from the perspective of someone whose life and work (as Credtent’s founder) is focused on making sure content creators are protected in the Age of AI. I’d note that ChatGPT’s Canvas helped me organize my thoughts as well, but I’ve rewritten most of its output because I’m a writer, not an #AISlacker. Still, this qualifies as AI-Assisted Content because I used AI as my collaborator.\\\\n\\\\nNow, with the disclosures out of the way, here’s the meat of the article.\\\\n\\\\nBelow, you’ll see an outline of what’s changing, what it means for you, and why you might want to reconsider your relationship with the platform. Sound like a good time? No, not really. But I hope this proves easier than parsing the legalese yourself.\\\\n\\\\n## What’s Changing?\\\\n\\\\nHere’s a breakdown of the major updates compared to the existing terms:\\\\n\\\\n- Data Usage: Facebook emphasizes that it doesn’t sell personal data but uses it extensively to deliver targeted ads and sponsored content. They also admit to leveraging advanced technologies (hello, AI!) for “research and development”. What could go wrong there?\\\\n\\\\n- Legacy Contacts: You can now appoint someone to manage your account posthumously. This sounds convenient and, to be honest, I’ve found it painful to see the occasional suggestion of a friend who I know has passed. But it opens the door to new privacy concerns, post-mortem.\\\\n\\\\n- Unilateral Terms Updates: By simply using the platform, you consent to any future changes. In other words, your agreement is automatic — whether or not you like the changes. If you stay on FB, you don’t need to accept terms — you’re opting in automagically.\\\\n\\\\n- Content Rights: Facebook retains broad rights over content you upload, including intellectual property. While it’s unclear how far this stretches, it raises questions about whether your creative work could be appropriated for purposes like AI training to produce work based on your own. We’ve already seen how FB content has been used in advertising without compensation or credit. This could get much worse.\\\\n\\\\n## Concerns for Content Creators\\\\n\\\\nIf you create content, Facebook’s new terms should raise a bright red flag. Here’s why:\\\\n\\\\n- AI Training Ambiguity: Meta admits to using AI and machine learning but stops short of specifying whether your content is used for training purposes. This lack of transparency leaves creators vulnerable to their work being exploited. Based on the past history of this and, frankly, most technology platforms, I’d be inclined to not trust this omission as being innocent.\\\\n\\\\n- Intellectual Property: While you retain ownership of your content, Facebook’s broad license to “use” it creates a gray area. What stops them from repurposing your video or photo for marketing campaigns — or worse, feeding it into an AI model to allows for creation of content that is competitive to your own?\\\\n\\\\n- Control Erosion: By continuing to use the platform, you implicitly are agreeing to future terms, giving Facebook a blank check to rewrite the rules as they see fit. Again, what could go wrong? We can’t know!\\\\n\\\\n## What’s at Stake for All Users\\\\n\\\\nEven if you’re not a content creator worried about your work being used against your future success, there’s still plenty to worry about:\\\\n\\\\n- Privacy: Meta claims it protects user privacy, but vague language about data analysis and AI leaves you wondering how much of your information is truly secure.\\\\n\\\\n- Account Management: Accounts can be (and have been) disabled (by Meta) for unclear violations. What happens to years of uploaded content if you’re suddenly locked out? This already happened to me once because of a scam. I tried to contact support but Meta made it nigh impossible to do anything about it — although scammers kept writing to me saying they could restore it for a fee. That’s some excellent customer service, huh?\\\\n\\\\n- Transparency: The absence of clear disclosures about AI training practices sets a dangerous precedent for big tech. If Facebook doesn’t explicitly outline its policies, who will? This is a bigger deal than you might think if you’re posting all kinds of pictures of yourself, your children, and your home.\\\\n\\\\n## Long-Term Repercussions\\\\n\\\\nSticking with Facebook post-2025 might begin to feel like maintaining access to a popular party or tribe while sacrificing your autonomy. The long-term risks include:\\\\n\\\\n- AI Entrapment: Your creative content could be mined to improve AI tools, with no opt-out clause. Imagine contributing to technology that competes with or devalues your own work. That said, Credtent.org IS sending opt-out requests to Meta for registered Credtent users. The legal fight over this dicey policy is coming so we’re preparing users for it.\\\\n\\\\n- Data Monopoly: The more data Facebook collects, the stronger its grip on user behavior and advertising markets. Users could face fewer alternatives as competitors struggle to keep up. Worse, how much (and how often) will Facebook sell their information to adtech and data brokers that can extrapolate a lot about you from your behavior. However much information you think is out there about you, let me be blunt — it’s 10X worse.\\\\n\\\\n- Legal Precedents: If unchecked, Facebook’s practices may influence other platforms to adopt similar, creator-unfriendly terms. I can’t imagine anybody wanting BlueSky, Medium and other sensible platforms to edge into these terms over time because we were just accepting them getting worse and worse.\\\\n\\\\n## What Should You Do?\\\\n\\\\nHere are some actionable strategies to start today to better protect yourself:\\\\n\\\\n- Diversify Platforms: Share your work on platforms like BlueSky, which explicitly refuses to train on user content, or Medium for long-form writing. This is what I am doing now. I’m also on Substack, although you need to directly opt-out of their use of your work for AI training.\\\\n\\\\n- Minimize Uploads: Use Facebook to post links to your external content rather than uploading original files directly. FB’s algorithm dings you for outbound links but it’s probably worth it in the end.\\\\n\\\\n- Monitor Updates: Keep an eye on Meta’s future changes and reconsider your use of the platform as needed. If it’s still worth it to you, have at it. For me, the camel’s back was broken years ago. I’m just getting tired of the pile of straw gathering on the poor thing.\\\\n\\\\n- Advocate for Regulation: Push for transparency and ethical AI practices in the tech industry. Your voice matters. Join Credtent.org to help fight back against unethical AI theft of your person and content.\\\\n\\\\n## Now is time to say goodbye to Meta\\\\n\\\\nMeta’s new terms make one thing clear: Using Facebook in 2025 comes with a huge knot of strings attached. Whether you’re a content creator or just someone who values privacy, now is the time to rethink your digital footprint. The platform may remain convenient (and “free” unless you’re an advertiser), but the cost — measured in rights and data — is higher than ever.\\\\n\\\\nFor me, I’m reducing my footprint to just posting links to my personal work elsewhere.

WE EXPLAIN SOME EXCEPTIONS AND HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION BELOW.\\\\n\\\\n1. MPT Products. Meta offers a variety of hardware and software products and services related to or in connection with those products as part of Meta Platforms Technologies. The hardware, services, features, apps, technologies, and software that are subject to these terms include the Meta VR Products and other Meta Platform Technologies products listed here, which may be updated from time to time (“MPT Products”).\\\\n\\\\n1.1. Accounts. We want our platform to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to agree to a few requirements before you can create an account to use our MPT Products:\\\\n\\\\n1.1.a. You must be at least 13 years of age to create one or more accounts supported by a MPT Product, such as a Meta account. You may create a Meta account on behalf of your child ages 10 to 12. When your child turns 13, they will have 30 days to start managing their Meta account or they will be blocked from using their device. Meta accounts for children ages 10 to 12 may not be supported on all MPT Products, including Meta Wearable Products.\\\\n\\\\n1.1.c. You may use the same Meta account to access different MPT Products, or you may create multiple different Meta accounts. However, except between you and your child ages 10 to 12 for whom you have created an account, you may not share passwords or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission).\\\\n\\\\n1.1.d. You must provide us with accurate and up to date information (including registration information), which may include providing your or your child’s personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone you aren’t.\\\\n\\\\n1.2. Meta Company Products. We may make certain Meta Company Products available for use on MPT Products. You may need to add your Meta account and other account types (such as a Facebook or Instagram account) to the same Accounts Center in order to access certain features or services offered by Meta Company Products (for example, you may need to add your Meta account to the same Accounts Center as your Facebook account in order to share content from a MPT Product on Facebook). If you choose to use these Meta Company Products, your use of them is subject to the relevant terms and conditions, including minimum age requirements, for those Meta Company Products (including relevant data policies).\\\\n\\\\n2. Your Commitments to Meta and Our Community\\\\n\\\\n2.1. Your responsibility for your use of MPT Products. You may only use MPT Products for personal non-commercial purposes unless otherwise expressly permitted in these Supplemental Terms or authorized by us in writing. Except as expressly permitted by us, you may not copy, modify, prepare directive works, distribute, sell, lease, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast, hack, emulate, or otherwise exploit any part of our services and software. Unless we are prohibited from restricting you under applicable law, you also may not reverse engineer any of the MPT Products or try to derive any of the software used in the MPT Products. You are also responsible for complying with all applicable laws when using MPT Products, including providing any notice to or obtaining any consents from other individuals who you interact with on your MPT Products as may be required under video recording, audio recording, biometric data, or other privacy or data protection laws. You are responsible for using your MPT Products in a safe, lawful, and respectful manner. For example, you may not tamper with the MPT Products, or otherwise obscure or modify any features that are intended to signal to others that the product is recording.\\\\n\\\\n2.3. Your responsibility for other users of your MPT Product. Each person, including you, who uses your MPT Product is referred to in these Supplemental Terms as a user of such products. You are responsible for the activities of all users of your MPT Products, and for their consent to and compliance with these Supplemental Terms. We encourage you to monitor others who use your MPT Products.\\\\n\\\\n2.4. Your responsibility for your child’s use of a Meta account to access MPT Products. You are responsible for determining that your child is ready to use MPT Products, consistent with the Health and Safety Warnings (see 5.5.d). If your child is below 10 years of age or otherwise not ready to use MPT Products as determined by you, you must not create an account for them. You are responsible for the activities of your child when they use a Meta account to access MPT Products, and for their compliance with these Supplemental Terms. You are responsible for supervising your child’s access to and use of MPT Products. You are responsible for ensuring your child understands these Supplemental Terms as well as other Terms and Policies that may apply, such as the Code of Conduct for Virtual Experiences, and ensuring they understand how to behave and interact with others when accessing MPT Products.\\\\n\\\\n3. The Permissions You Give Us\\\\n\\\\n3.3. Permission to use your name, profile picture, and information about your actions with ads and sponsored or commercial content. You give us permission to use your profile name, profile picture, and information about actions you have taken in MPT Products (for example, apps you use) next to or in connection with ads, offers, and other sponsored or commercial content that we display in MPT Products without any compensation to you. Additionally, if you choose to connect your Meta account with other Meta Company Products accounts (such as your Facebook or Instagram accounts), you also give us permission to display your profile information and information about actions you have taken in MPT Products across Meta Company Products. Ads and content like this can be seen only by people who have your permission to see the actions you've taken in MPT Products consistent with your privacy settings.\\\\n\\\\n4. What You Can Share and Do on MPT Products\\\\n\\\\n4.1. Permission to use. If your MPT Product includes software applications, content, or virtual items other than Third-Party Services (“Software and Content”) that have been enabled for your use, we hereby grant you a personal, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited right and license to access, use, and download (as permitted by the functionality of the MPT Products) that Software and Content on MPT Products devices you own or control, solely for personal non-commercial purposes (except as expressly authorized by Meta in writing), conditioned on your compliance with these Supplemental Terms. Any unauthorized use of the MPT Products, including the Software and Content, is strictly prohibited and will cause the license granted in these Supplemental Terms to terminate automatically. No licenses or rights are granted to you by implication or otherwise, except for the licenses and rights expressly granted to you herein or in any other applicable terms. The Software and Content are the property of Meta, its affiliates, or its licensors, and are only licensed, not sold to you. Meta also requires that you use only the then-current version of the Software and Content.\\\\n\\\\n4.2. Third-Party Services. MPT Products can be used to access software, applications, services, content, and virtual items (including, but not limited to, third-party digital content, additional or enhanced functionality, or media content purchased through MPT Products) provided by third parties (“Third-Party Services”). In some cases, Meta or its affiliates may distribute Third-Party Services to you on behalf of the third party.\\\\n\\\\n4.2.a. Third-Party Terms. Your use of a Third-Party Service may be subject to additional terms, conditions, fees, and policies imposed by the third party (together, “Third-Party Terms”). Meta is not a party to these Third-Party Terms. However, in the event that Third-Party Terms conflict with the provisions of these Supplemental Terms, these Supplemental Terms will govern. You are responsible for complying with any applicable Third-Party Terms, and we recommend that you review any applicable Third-Party Terms before using Third-Party Services. We have no obligations or liability for (i) your access to or use of any Third-Party Services, (ii) any information that you provide or authorize us to provide to any Third-Party Services, or (iii) such third party’s collection, use, or disclosure of such information. If you have connected to a Third-Party Service on a MPT Product, you may remain connected using saved credentials unless you take action to discontinue access to that service (such as by changing the applicable account settings for the relevant Third-Party Service).\\\\n\\\\n4.2.b. Default End User License. If you are not presented with an end user license agreement when you acquire Third-Party Services, the following license terms apply to your use of such Third-Party Services: (a) the third party providing the Third-Party Services (and not Meta or its affiliates) is the licensor of such Third-Party Services; (b) such third party grants you a limited, non-transferable license to access and use the Third-Party Services only for your personal and non-commercial purposes; and (c) you may not modify, decompile or disassemble the Third-Party Services in whole or in part, or create any derivative works from or sublicense any rights in or to the Third-Party Services, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the third party or as permitted under applicable law notwithstanding these restrictions. Meta and its affiliates are not parties to the license agreement between you and the provider of such Third-Party Services or other Third-Party Terms.\\\\n\\\\n4.2.c. Discontinuation of Third-Party Services. Third-Party Services may require access to data about Meta users and Meta services, which access is subject to agreements between Third-Party Service providers and Meta. We may disable this access for a Third-Party Service if the Third-Party Service provider breaches these agreements, our policies, or applicable law, or if the agreements are otherwise terminated. This may adversely affect your use of such Third-Party Services, including by making such Third-Party Services partially or fully inoperable. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we will have no liability to you for removing or disabling access to data and services by a third party for these reasons. This means, without limitation, that Meta will not provide you with any refunds for such Third-Party Services in these cases. Any rights, including refund claims, which you may have under your agreements with third parties remain unaffected.\\\\n\\\\n4.4. Objectionable Content. We may display age, comfort, and content ratings for digital content (including ads) that are based on information provided to us by the developers of such content, and which are not verified by Meta, unless expressly mentioned. We cannot guarantee that digital content ratings will always be accurate, nor can we promise that you will not find some material harmful, inappropriate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable, including material that may be found through accessing third-party links or other Third-Party Services. You understand that you may be exposed to content from a variety of sources when using MPT Products and acknowledge that content may be inaccurate, inappropriate, offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable. You agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Meta will not be responsible or liable for content posted by you, other users of MPT Products, or a third party.\\\\n\\\\n4.5. Age Restrictions. You may only access certain digital content if you are of or above the age displayed to you when you order the digital content. If we determine that you did not comply with these age requirements, we may disable your access to the digital content and we will not refund the amounts paid for the digital content.\\\\n\\\\n5. Additional Provisions\\\\n\\\\n5.1. Functionality may change or be limited. We work constantly to improve MPT Products and respond to changing needs of our community. As part of this continual improvement, we may introduce new features or services, impose limits on, change, suspend, disable, remove, replace, update, upgrade, roll back, or restrict access to features, services, software, content or any part of MPT Products (including Meta Products or Meta Company Products). If a feature, service, software or content is no longer available, or if a technical error occurs, information, data, or content created or provided by you in connection with such feature, service, software or content may be deleted or become inaccessible, and you should not exclusively rely on any feature, service, software or content to store or preserve such information, data or content. In addition, certain features, services, software or content may be disabled or made available in modified form based on your age or location. We may offer free trials or other limited versions of the MPT Products so that you can preview these products before purchase. These versions may have limited features, restrict the permitted time of use and contain other limitations. The features, functionality, or availability of a Third-Party Service may change or be discontinued, including if the developer of such Third-Party Service violates our terms or policies, or in accordance with the Terms or the applicable Third-Party Terms.\\\\n\\\\n5.3. Updates to these Supplemental Terms. These Supplemental Terms may be updated from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices, to promote a safe and secure experience on the MPT Products, and/or comply with applicable law. Unless the changes are required by law, we will notify you before we make changes to these Supplemental Terms or any Commercial Terms (if the changes are applicable to the MPT Products used by you), and give you an opportunity to review the updated terms before they go into effect. We hope that you will continue using MPT Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Supplemental Terms, you must cease use of MPT Products. Your continued use of MPT Products after the effective date of the updated Supplemental Terms constitutes your acceptance of those terms.\\\\n\\\\n5.4. Third-Party Fees and Costs. You are responsible for the fees, costs, and other charges, such as internet usage or utilities fees, associated with use of MPT Products, as well as fees, costs, and other charges associated with Third-Party Services.\\\\n\\\\n5.5. Disclaimers; Limitations of Liability; Indemnification.\\\\n\\\\n5.5.b. Unless a separate limited warranty is provided, certain hardware products of the MPT Products are covered by the Limited Warranty offered by Meta Platforms Technologies, LLC. Nothing in these Supplemental Terms is intended to either abridge or expand the scope of those limited warranties.\\\\n\\\\n5.5.c. Certain MPT Products may have communication or calling capabilities. However, there are important differences between such MPT Products and a mobile or fixed-line telephone service. MPT Products do not provide access to emergency services or emergency service providers (including the police, fire departments, or hospitals), or otherwise connect to public safety answering points. You should ensure you can contact your relevant emergency service providers through a mobile telephone, fixed-line telephone, or other service.\\\\n\\\\n5.5.d. THERE ARE IMPORTANT HEALTH AND SAFETY WARNINGS, INFORMATION, AND INSTRUCTIONS (“HEALTH AND SAFETY WARNINGS”) THAT YOU MUST READ BEFORE USING MPT PRODUCTS OR ALLOWING YOUR CHILD TO USE MPT PRODUCTS, AVAILABLE HERE. THESE INCLUDE WARNINGS, INFORMATION, AND INSTRUCTIONS THAT A PARENT OR GUARDIAN MUST REVIEW AND CONSIDER BEFORE DETERMINING THAT THEIR CHILD IS READY FOR MPT PRODUCTS AND SETTING UP AN ACCOUNT ON THEIR BEHALF. WARNING: FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE HEALTH AND SAFETY WARNINGS AND INSTRUCTIONS MAY RESULT IN DAMAGE TO MPT PRODUCTS OR ACCESSORIES, AND MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, DISCOMFORT OR OTHER POTENTIAL HAZARDS. BY USING MPT PRODUCTS, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE REVIEWED THESE WARNINGS AND INSTRUCTIONS AND ENSURE THAT ALL USERS OF YOUR MPT PRODUCTS READ AND UNDERSTAND THE HEALTH AND SAFETY WARNINGS AND INSTRUCTIONS (AND WILL REVIEW ANY UPDATES THERETO), AND WILL ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH WARNINGS AND INSTRUCTIONS.\\\\n\\\\n5.5.e. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold harmless Meta and its affiliates from and against all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your purchase or use of the MPT Products; (ii) your actual or alleged breach of these Supplemental Terms or any other applicable terms, policies, warnings or instructions provided by Meta or a third party in relation to the MPT Products; (iii) your violation of any applicable law or any rights of any third party; (iv) any content you provide, upload, or transmit while using MPT Products, or (v) any access to or use of MPT Products by any third party to whom you have made available MPT Products access or use. In the event that you provide Meta’s defense to such a claim, you agree that Meta (a) shall be consulted regarding, and shall have the right to approve (at our sole discretion), defense strategy, any appeal, and any settlement of the claim, (b) shall have the right to select defense counsel, and (c) may further participate in the defense of the claim with counsel of our own choice at our own expense.\\\\n\\\\n5.6. Dispute Resolution.\\\\n\\\\nPLEASE READ THIS SECTION 5.6 CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT. THIS SECTION 5.6 REQUIRES YOU TO SUBMIT TO BINDING ARBITRATION ANY AND ALL DISPUTES (EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR BELOW) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS, OR ANY PERSONAL USE OF MPT PRODUCTS, AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.a. What claims must be arbitrated. Except as provided below, you and Meta agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or dispute between you and Meta arising out of or related to these Supplemental Terms, or the purchase or personal use of MPT Products (“claim(s)”) must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. By agreeing to arbitrate, you and Meta expressly waive the rights to sue in court and trial by jury. Our past, present, and future affiliates and agents, as well as any of our successors and assigns, can invoke our rights under this agreement in the event they become involved in a dispute.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.b. What claims won’t be arbitrated. Instead of using arbitration, you or Meta can bring claims in your local “small claims” court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don’t bring your claims in small claims court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. In addition, only a court may decide claims to enforce your or Meta’s intellectual property rights (like copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets) or resolve issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision or whether subsection 5.6.c (requiring individual arbitration), subsection 5.6.d (requiring pre-arbitration notice of disputes), or subsection 5.6.f (regarding coordinated arbitrations) have been violated. Moreover, nothing in these Terms will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief from us on your behalf.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.c. Arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and class arbitrations are not permitted; for example, you may bring a claim only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other users of MPT Products. Nor may an arbitrator consolidate arbitrations unless all parties agree. If there is a final judicial determination that the limitations of this paragraph are unenforceable as to a particular claim or a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief), then that claim or request for relief will be decided by a court after all other claims and requests for relief are arbitrated.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.d. Notice of claims before arbitration. Before you or Meta commence arbitration of a claim, the claimant must provide the other party with a written Notice of Dispute that includes your username, the claimant’s name and contact information, a detailed description of the dispute, the specific relief sought, and the claimant’s signature. If you send the Notice, it also must include your residence address (and mailing address if different), the email address and mobile phone number you use with your account, and if you are represented by an attorney, a signed statement authorizing Meta to discuss your account and share your confidential account information with your attorney. Any Notice of Dispute you send to Meta should be mailed to Meta Platforms, Inc., ATTN: MPT Arbitration Filing, 1 Meta Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025 (“Notice Address”). Before Meta commences arbitration, Meta will send you a Notice of Dispute to the email address you use with your account or when you access MPT Products or by other appropriate means. If you and we are unable to resolve a dispute within 60 days after a fully complete Notice of Dispute is received, you or Meta may commence arbitration, but neither party may commence an arbitration during this 60-day period. If any aspect of the requirements in this subsection have not been met, a court can enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations. In addition, unless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration provider cannot accept or administer the arbitration, nor assess any fees for such an arbitration. If the arbitration already is pending, it must be dismissed.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.e. How arbitration works. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by this arbitration provision. The AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules are available at https://www.adr.org or by writing to the Notice Address. If the AAA cannot or will not administer the arbitration in accordance with this arbitration provision, another arbitration provider will be selected by the parties or, if there is no agreement, by the court. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, unless the arbitrator determines that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel. The arbitrator may consider rulings in other arbitrations involving other claimants, but an arbitrator’s ruling will not be binding in proceedings involving different claimants. Except as provided in subsection 18.3, the arbitrator can award the same relief that a court can award under applicable law, including sanctions against any represented party or counsel permitted under the AAA rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), or other applicable federal or state law.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.e.1. Costs of arbitration. Meta will pay all AAA or arbitrator fees for any arbitration Meta brings. If you are assessed any such fees for any arbitration you bring, we will pay those fees on your behalf, so long as you have fully complied with subsections 5.6.c, 5.6.d, and 5.6.g and your claims seek relief valued at less than $75,000. In all cases, the arbitrator may reallocate these fees in accordance with the AAA’s rules regarding frivolous or improper claims or vexatious litigation.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.f. Arbitration of coordinated claims. If 25 or more claimants submit similar Notices of Dispute or file similar arbitrations and are represented by the same or coordinated counsel (regardless of whether the cases are pursued simultaneously), all of the cases must be resolved in arbitration in staged proceedings. You agree to this process even though it might delay the arbitration of your claim. In the first stage, claimants’ counsel and Meta will each select up to 25 cases (50 cases total) to be filed in arbitration and resolved individually by separate arbitrators. If feasible, arbitrators will be from the respective claimants’ home states.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"As stated in the Meta Terms of Service, we don’t sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don’t share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission.\\\",\\n      \\\"source\\\": \\\"web\\\",\\n      \\\"price\\\": 0.0015,\\n      \\\"length\\\": 24990,\\n      \\\"image_url\\\": {},\\n      \\\"relevance_score\\\": 0.8150897883604115,\\n      \\\"data_type\\\": \\\"unstructured\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Meta Platforms Technologies Products Commercial Terms | Meta Store\\\",\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.meta.com/legal/quest/commercial-terms/?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\\\",\\n      \\\"content\\\": \\\"Meta Platforms Technologies Products Commercial Terms\\\\n\\\\nIf you are an individual engaged in any commercial use of a MPT Product, you represent and warrant that you are not doing so as an individual consumer.

Nothing in these MPT Commercial Terms or the Supplemental Terms is intended to either abridge or expand the scope of that Limited Warranty. NOTE: YOUR COMMERCIAL USE OF META PLATFORMS TECHNOLOGIES PRODUCTS DOES NOT PROVIDE YOU ENTERPRISE-LEVEL WARRANTY AND SUPPORT SERVICES, WHICH MAY OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE FOR EXISTING META VR PRODUCTS OR MPT PRODUCTS.To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold harmless Meta and its affiliates, its and their independent contractors and service providers, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, “Meta Parties”), from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or in any way connected with (a) your purchase or use of, or inability to use, the MPT Products, (b) your violation of any applicable law or any rights of any third party, (c) any actual or alleged breach by you (or by any third party to whom you made available access or use of the MPT Products) of the Terms or any other applicable terms, policies, warnings, or instructions provided by Meta or a third party in relation to the MPT Products, (d) any use of a MPT Product in violation of applicable law, or any distribution, transfer, or export of a MPT Product, by you and any other user of the MPT Products, (e) any content you provide, upload, or transmit via Meta Products, and (f) any access to or use of the MPT Products by any third party to whom you have made available access or use of the MPT Products.

MPT Products were not designed for High Risk Use or any activities requiring fail-safe performance. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim any responsibility for any High Risk Use of MPT Products, and disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness of MPT Products for a High Risk Use.\\\\n\\\\nYou agree to arbitrate any claim, cause of action, or dispute between you and Meta that arises out of or relates to these MPT Commercial Terms or your commercial use of the MPT Products (“Commercial Claim”). This provision does not cover any commercial claims relating to (i) violations of your or our intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, copyright infringement, patent infringement, trademark infringement, violations of the Brand Usage Guidelines, violations of your or our confidential information or trade secrets, or (ii) efforts to interfere with MPT Products or engage with MPT Products in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). If a Commercial Claim between you and Meta is not subject to arbitration, you and Meta agree that such claim must be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County, and that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim.

If there is a final judicial determination that any particular Commercial Claim (or a request for particular relief) cannot be arbitrated according to the limitations of this Section, then only that Commercial Claim (or only that request for relief) may be severed and brought in court. All other Commercial Claims (or requests for relief) will remain subject to this Section. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. All issues are for an arbitrator to decide, except that only a court may decide issues relating to the scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision or the interpretation of the prohibition of class and representative actions. If any party intends to seek arbitration of a dispute, that party must provide the other party with notice in writing. This notice of dispute to us must be sent to the following address: Meta Platforms, Inc., 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025.

The arbitrator will not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations in which you are not a party. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any evidentiary submissions made in arbitration will be maintained as confidential in the absence of good cause for its disclosure. The arbitrator’s award will be maintained as confidential only to the extent necessary to protect either party’s trade secrets or proprietary business information or to comply with a legal requirement mandating confidentiality. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA Rules, except that we will pay for your filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your Commercial Claim for damages does not exceed USD $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If you do not wish to be bound by this provision (including its waiver of class and representative claims), you must notify us as set forth below within 30 days of the first acceptance date of any version of these MPT Commercial Terms containing an arbitration provision (we note, for clarity, that the date on which you make your first commercial use of a MPT Product pursuant to these MPT Commercial Terms will constitute such acceptance date). Such notice to us must be submitted to the address here: Meta Platforms, Inc., 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025.

If changes to these MPT Commercial Terms would adversely impact your commercial use of MPT Products or your responsibilities under these MPT Commercial Terms, we will notify you before we make such changes and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. We may also notify you in advance regarding other changes to these MPT Commercial Terms where required to do so by applicable law.

The policy is valid from data acquisition and collection by the ONS, and it also extends through the lifecycle up to and including data archiving and data disposal.\\\\n\\\\nThis policy applies to all UK Statistics Authority and ONS employees, including staff on fixed-term, temporary or permanent contract, staff on secondment, students and contractors.\\\\n\\\\nMetadata provide information about other data, including a description of the data. This includes information that provides context to the data (for example, how it was collected), or the coverage of the data (for example, publication date, description and search keywords).\\\\n\\\\nThe ONS needs to hold and manage a comprehensive set of unambiguous metadata relating to the data it manages, in order to understand the data, fully extract the value from the data and employ appropriate security measures to protect the data.\\\\n\\\\nThe ONS Data Strategy specifies data principles for managing data; data policies support the implementation of these principles. This metadata policy aligns with the data principles and underpins the management and governance of metadata in the ONS. The metadata must comply with the data principles.\\\\n\\\\nMetadata provide information about other data and are essential in aiding understanding of the data and ensuring that appropriate security measures are employed to protect the data. Metadata will be defined and centrally maintained for all data held by the ONS from acquisition to dissemination, archiving and disposal.\\\\n\\\\nAll data acquired and collected by the ONS from external and internal sources must be accompanied by metadata. The ONS Metadata Model defines the minimum set of metadata that must accompany all data acquired by the ONS. In practice, captured metadata will go beyond the defined minimum set of metadata. In order to provide a framework for managing metadata, metadata categories have been defined and all metadata will be categorised according to these categories.\\\\n\\\\nONS Information assets held on the Information and Data Asset Register will be assigned a Metadata Owner, in addition to the Information Asset Owner. The Metadata Owner will periodically review the quality of the metadata they own and will initiate corrective action to address any issues found with the accuracy and quality of the metadata.\\\\n\\\\nThe ONS Business Glossary holds definitions for the main terms used within the ONS. Glossary Term Owners are appointed at the time of data acquisition, creation or amendment, and are responsible for maintaining their terms, updating and consolidating them with other terms as appropriate.\\\\n\\\\n1. Metadata will be defined and centrally maintained for all data held by the ONS from acquisition to archiving and disposal:\\\\n\\\\n- data acquired and collected by the ONS from external and internal sources must be accompanied by metadata; the metadata must contain at least a minimum set of metadata elements that are shared across the ONS data estate\\\\n\\\\n- data provided by the ONS to external recipients must be accompanied by metadata; this metadata must be up-to-date managed metadata\\\\n\\\\n- new data created by the ONS (for example, statistical outputs, including internally created new variables and datasets) must be accompanied by metadata\\\\n\\\\n- data held in ONS-managed data archives must be accompanied by metadata\\\\n\\\\n- metadata will be retained for data that has been deleted (disposed of), including the date of deletion\\\\n\\\\n- metadata will be retained for the appropriate period specified by the retention policy\\\\n\\\\n2.

We don't allow apps with misleading, improperly formatted, non-descriptive, irrelevant, excessive, or inappropriate metadata, including but not limited to the app's description, developer name, title, icon, screenshots, and promotional images. Developers must provide a clear and well-written description of their app. We also don't allow unattributed or anonymous user testimonials in the app's description. Your app title, icon, and developer name are particularly helpful for users to find and learn about your app. Don’t use emojis, emoticons, or repeated special characters in these metadata elements. Avoid ALL CAPS unless it is part of your brand name. Misleading symbols in app icons are not allowed, for example: new message dot indicator when there are no new messages and download/install symbols when the app is not related to downloading content. Your app title must be 30 characters or less. Don’t use text or image in the app title, icon, or developer name that indicate store performance or ranking, price or promotional information, or that suggests relations to existing Google Play programs. In addition to the requirements noted here, specific Google Play Developer Policies may require you to provide additional metadata information.\\\\n\\\\n## Examples of common violations\\\\n\\\\n① Unattributed or Anonymous User testimonials ② Data comparison of apps or brands ③ Word blocks and vertical/horizontal word lists\\\\n\\\\n① ALL CAPS although not part of brand name ② Special character sequences that are irrelevant to the app ③ Use of emojis, emoticons(including kaomojis), and special characters ④ Misleading symbol ⑤ Misleading text\\\\n\\\\n- Images or text that indicate store performance or ranking, such as 'App of the year,' '#1,' 'Best of Play 20XX,' 'Popular,' award icons, etc. - Images or text that indicate price and promotional information, such as '10% off,' '$50 cash back,' 'free for limited time only,' etc. - Images or text that indicate Google Play programs, such as 'Editor’s choice,' 'New,' etc.\\\\n\\\\n#### Here are some examples of inappropriate text, images, or videos within your listing:\\\\n\\\\n- Imagery or videos with sexually suggestive content. Avoid suggestive imagery containing breasts, buttocks, genitalia, or other fetishized anatomy or content, whether illustrated or real. - Using profane, vulgar, or other language that is inappropriate for a general audience in your app’s Store listing. - Graphic violence prominently depicted in app icons, promotional images, or videos. - Depictions of the illicit usage of drugs. Even EDSA (Educational, Documentary, Scientific, or Artistic) content must be suitable for all audiences within the store listing.\\\\n\\\\n#### Here are a few best practices:\\\\n\\\\n- Highlight what's great about your app. Share interesting and exciting facts about your app to help users understand what makes your app special. - Make sure that your app’s title and description accurately describe your app’s functionality. - Avoid using repetitive or unrelated keywords or references. - Keep your app’s description succinct and straightforward. Shorter descriptions tend to result in a better user experience, especially on devices with smaller displays. Excessive length, detail, improper formatting, or repetition can result in a violation of this policy. - Remember that your listing should be suitable for a general audience. Avoid using inappropriate text, images or videos in your listing and adhere to the guidelines above.\\\\n\\\\nHelp us improve this policy article by taking a 2-minute survey.\\\\n\\\\n## Was this helpful?\\\\n\\\\nHow can we improve it?\\\\n\\\\nYesNo\\\\n\\\\n## Need more help?\\\\n\\\\n### Try these next steps:\\\\n\\\\n[Post to the help community Get answers from community members](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/community?hl=en&help_center_link=CNqW3AQSCE1ldGFkYXRh) [Contact us Tell us more and we’ll help you get there](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/gethelp)\\\\n\\\\ntrue\\\\n\\\\nSearchClear searchClose searchGoogle appsMain menu\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Users depend on descriptions of your app to help them understand its functionality and purpose.

In addition to the information provided to data subjects by Meta Ireland via the Information about Page Insights, you should identify your own legal basis including the legitimate interests you pursue\\\\n\\\\nYou can create your own custom clause to disclose your use of Page Insights. [Visit our page to learn more](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/386-how-to-add-a-custom-service-and-customize-to-your-needs).\\\\n\\\\nMost importantly, if [GDPR applies to your situation](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/5428#gdprApplies), do not forget to mention on which legal base you are relying on in order to process statistical data. You can rely on any of the[6 legal bases provided under the GDPR.](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/5428-gdpr-guide#1-legal-basis-for-processing-data)\\\\n\\\\n## Meta’s responsibilities\\\\n\\\\nAs stated in the [Page Insights Controller Addendum](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum), Meta is taking on major responsibilities:\\\\n\\\\n> Unless specified otherwise in this Page Insights Addendum, between you and Meta Ireland, Meta Ireland assumes the responsibility for compliance with the applicable obligations under the GDPR for the processing of Insights data (including, but not limited to, Articles 12 and 13 GDPR, Articles 15 to 21 GDPR, Articles 33 and 34 GDPR). Meta Ireland will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the processing in accordance with Article 32 GDPR.\\\\n\\\\n### Joint controllership\\\\n\\\\nThe processing of personal data for Page Insights might be subject to the joint controllership arrangement: basically, if you’re a Facebook Page admin, both you and Meta are responsible for complying with the [GDPR](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/5428) in relation to Meta’s Page Insights service.\\\\n\\\\nIn any case, there is **no need to add a joint controller statement**, since Meta takes care of this aspect:\\\\n\\\\n> Meta Ireland will make the essence of this Page Insights Addendum available to data subjects (Article 26(2) GDPR). This is currently done via the Information about Page Insights data which can be accessed from all Pages.\\\\n\\\\n### Facebook Page Insights Controller Addendum Requests\\\\n\\\\nIf you need assistance with regard to a request in accordance with the Page Insights Controller Addendum, you can [submit this form](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/308592359910928):\\\\n\\\\nIn fact, on the Page Insights Controller Addendum Meta says:\\\\n\\\\n> If data subjects exercise their rights under the GDPR with regard to the processing of Insights data against you (Article 26(3) GDPR), or you are contacted by a supervisory authority with regard to the processing of Insights data, each a “request”, you will forward all relevant information regarding such requests to us promptly but within a maximum of seven calendar days.

This is especially true if you use tools that connect your websites, apps, and marketing activities to Facebook.\\\\n\\\\n- What data Facebook collects\\\\n\\\\n- How Meta uses it\\\\n\\\\n- What steps you need to take to meet your legal obligations and be transparent with your customers\\\\n\\\\nIf your business decides how and why personal data is collected or used, then under many global privacy laws you are accountable starting from the moment you collect it, and even after it’s shared with third parties like Meta.\\\\n\\\\nUnderstanding what data Facebook collects and how Meta uses that data matters for several other reasons, detailed below.\\\\n\\\\n### Regulatory compliance\\\\n\\\\nMeta must use the data you share in a way that meets regulatory requirements. Data privacy laws generally protect data belonging to individuals located in the law’s region of jurisdiction — like many countries under the European Union, a single country like Canada, or a US state.\\\\n\\\\nYou may be required to comply with several laws, depending on where your audience or customers are located, and what industry your business is in. Some of the most common global privacy laws are:\\\\n\\\\n- The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\\\\n\\\\n- Multiple US state-level data privacy laws, including, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)\\\\n\\\\n- Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (LGPD)\\\\n\\\\n- South Africa’s Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA)\\\\n\\\\n- Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)\\\\n\\\\n### Customer expectations\\\\n\\\\nAccording to data from Salesforce, 71 percent of customers are increasingly protective of their personal information. That growing caution makes it more important than ever for businesses to be clear about who has access to users’ personal data and how it’s used.\\\\n\\\\nIf your practices aren’t transparent — or if users feel misled — it can erode trust and harm your reputation.\\\\n\\\\n### Business impact\\\\n\\\\nFacebook’s data policies influence how effective your ads and analytics will be. Understanding what data Facebook uses and how it processes that data helps you make better decisions about targeting, measurement, and spend.\\\\n\\\\n### Evolving regulations\\\\n\\\\nNewer laws like the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) restrict how Meta can combine and use EU users’ data collected from one product — like Facebook — across its ecosystem. Meta has multiple platforms and billions of users, so this is a notable restriction on the data and revenue potential in their operations.\\\\n\\\\nThese changes affect how your business can use Meta tools for audience insights, cross-platform tracking, and personalized advertising in the EU. That means ongoing awareness is necessary for continued compliance.\\\\n\\\\n## Understanding Facebook’s data privacy policies and practices\\\\n\\\\nFacebook processes large volumes of personal data that’s collected from both users and businesses that use Meta Business Tools on their websites and apps.\\\\n\\\\nIn some regions, Facebook may also use data collected from other Meta platforms — such as Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp — depending on local privacy laws and user consent.\\\\n\\\\nHere’s a look at what data Facebook collects and how it’s used.\\\\n\\\\n### What data does Facebook collect?\\\\n\\\\n- User-provided information: Includes details that users enter when creating an account or making a purchase, such as their email address, phone number, age, profile photo, and payment or delivery information if they use Meta Pay or checkout features.\\\\n\\\\n- User activity: Facebook tracks what users click, post, like, and share, as well as who they message and otherwise interact with. Engagement with both ads and organic content is tracked.\\\\n\\\\n- App, browser, and device information: Facebook collectsdata from users’ phones, computers, or tablets, including: Device type Operating system Battery level Signal strength IP address App version Network GPS location Photos and camera access\\\\n\\\\n- Device type\\\\n\\\\n- Operating system\\\\n\\\\n- Battery level\\\\n\\\\n- Signal strength\\\\n\\\\n- IP address\\\\n\\\\n- App version\\\\n\\\\n- Network\\\\n\\\\n- GPS location\\\\n\\\\n- Photos and camera access\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to this user data, Facebook receives personal data from the businesses that use its tools.\\\\n\\\\nIf your business integrates Meta Business Tools — such as the Facebook Pixel, SDK, or Conversions API — that means you’re actively sending data about your website or app visitors to Meta. This may include pages viewed, purchases completed, or in-app events triggered by users.\\\\n\\\\n### How do Facebook and Meta use this information?\\\\n\\\\n#### Personalization (including ads)\\\\n\\\\n#### Product improvement\\\\n\\\\nMeta applies user activity information to enhance existing products and develop new features. It also uses device information, such as what’s happening in the background when a Meta app crashes.\\\\n\\\\n#### Safety and security\\\\n\\\\nMeta uses this information to detect and prevent suspicious activity, harmful behavior, spam, and fraud, aiming to keep the platform safe for users and businesses.\\\\n\\\\n#### Measurement and analytics\\\\n\\\\nMeta provides businesses with analytics and reports on ad performance and user engagement. It often uses data shared by businesses through Business Tools.\\\\n\\\\n### Role of cookies and tracking technologies\\\\n\\\\nMeta uses cookies, pixels, and other tracking technologies to collect personal data for a range of uses, including analytics and ad targeting.\\\\n\\\\nFacebook uses these tools to gather information from people who have Facebook accounts, use other Meta products and platforms, or visit third-party websites and apps that integrate Meta Products, such as the “like” or “share” buttons.\\\\n\\\\nImportantly, these tracking technologies can collect data from a person even if they aren’t logged into a Facebook account or don’t have a Facebook account at all (except for users in the European Region).\\\\n\\\\nWhen your business adds Meta Business Tools to your website, app, or online store, Meta can set and read cookies. Meta can then collect information about any visitor, not just Facebook users.\\\\n\\\\nThat means Meta builds advertising and analytics profiles using data from both its users and individuals who don’t use its platforms.\\\\n\\\\nMeta maintains a separate cookies policy that outlines its use of these tracking technologies. If your business receives traffic from visitors in regions with explicit consent requirements — which is an ever-increasing percentage of the world — it’s particularly important to review Meta’s cookies policy carefully.\\\\n\\\\nYou’ll need to implement consent mechanisms that meet legal standards and update your own privacy notices to reflect Meta’s tracking activities on your site.\\\\n\\\\nUnsure about what type of consent you need? Learn the differences between opt-in and opt-out consent and which type you need under different global privacy laws.\\\\n\\\\n### Who does Meta share personal data with?\\\\n\\\\nMeta shares personal data with some third parties for a variety of purposes.\\\\n\\\\nWhile the company states it doesn’t sell personal information, this kind of sharing can legally qualify as a “sale” of personal information under laws like the CCPA/CPRA, even when no money is exchanged.\\\\n\\\\nThe third parties Meta shares data with include the following:\\\\n\\\\n- Advertisers: Businesses that advertise on Meta’s platforms\\\\n\\\\n- Commerce and service partners: Businesses that offer goods or services on Facebook or other Meta products and platforms, as well as any providers acting on their behalf (for example, a payment processor)\\\\n\\\\n- Vendors and service providers: Third-party services that Meta uses to promote its own products, conduct research and surveys, deliver customer service, facilitate payments, analyze product usage, and investigate suspicious activity, among other things\\\\n\\\\n- Academic and public interest researchers: External researchers who focus on topics like safety, technology, or social impact\\\\n\\\\nBoth the data shared and who it’s shared with may vary based on how your business uses Meta Business Tools and what privacy choices users make.\\\\n\\\\n### International data transfers\\\\n\\\\nMeta transfers personal data across borders as part of its global operations. This includes sending data to countries where:\\\\n\\\\n- It has infrastructure, such as the United States, Ireland, Denmark, and Sweden, among others\\\\n\\\\n- Meta products are available\\\\n\\\\n- Its partners, vendors, service providers, and other third parties are located\\\\n\\\\nTo carry out these international data transfers in compliance with applicable privacy laws, Meta relies on legal mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and adequacy decisions.\\\\n\\\\nFor data transfers from the EU to the US, Meta states that, as of September 7, 2023, it relies on the EU-US Data Privacy Framework.\\\\n\\\\n### Sensitive information restrictions\\\\n\\\\nMeta prohibits businesses and partners from sharing certain types of sensitive information through its platform and tools.\\\\n\\\\nThis information includes, but is not limited to:\\\\n\\\\n- Health or medical data\\\\n\\\\n- Detailed financial data\\\\n\\\\n- Government ID numbers\\\\n\\\\n- GPS location data\\\\n\\\\n- Social Security numbers or local equivalents\\\\n\\\\n- Passwords\\\\n\\\\n- Any information that the sharer knows — or reasonably should know — is from or about a child under the age of 13\\\\n\\\\nIf Meta determines that a business may be violating these terms, it reserves the right to take action against that business.\\\\n\\\\n## How to align your business with privacy laws and Facebook privacy requirements\\\\n\\\\nWhile understanding Meta’s data practices is important, you must also be aware of your business’s direct responsibilities when handling user data in connection with Facebook, Meta Business Tools, and Meta products.\\\\n\\\\nBelow are the primary obligations you need to follow.\\\\n\\\\n### Meet EU consent standards under the GDPR and the DMA\\\\n\\\\nIf your business operates in the EU or targets users there, the Digital Markets Act (DMA) also requires Meta to obtain explicit user consent before combining personal data collected on your website with account information from Facebook or other Meta platforms for analytics or targeting.\\\\n\\\\nTo stay compliant, your consent banner or consent management platform (CMP) must clearly inform users of this data use and enable them to opt in.\\\\n\\\\nMonitor Facebook’s updates in the EU to make sure your consent collection practices align with both Facebook’s expectations and DMA requirements.\\\\n\\\\n### Follow data minimization principles\\\\n\\\\nWhen collecting personal data, practice data minimization by gathering only what you need. This helps you to comply with the GDPR and avoid sharing data that may be prohibited or unnecessary for your stated purpose.\\\\n\\\\n### Understand US opt-out requirements\\\\n\\\\nUS states that have implemented data privacy laws to date use an opt-out consent model. In most cases, prior consent for data collection and processing is not required, including for profiling or advertising. It is only necessary to enable users to opt out.\\\\n\\\\nMeta provides a Limited Data Use (LDU) parameter to help businesses comply. When enabled, Meta will limit how it processes the user’s data in line with the applicable state law, if that user had opted out.\\\\n\\\\nThe CCPA/CPRA includes an additional obligation that provides California residents the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal data for profiling or targeted advertising. Businesses must honor this right by prominently displaying a “Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Information” button or link.\\\\n\\\\nMany businesses choose to add this to their cookie banner, website footer, or app menu. You must also immediately stop sharing users’ data with Meta or other third parties when they exercise their right to opt out.\\\\n\\\\n### Follow purpose limitation principles\\\\n\\\\n### Protect the data you handle\\\\n\\\\nYour business is responsible for protecting any personal data it collects, processes, or shares, even after it has been shared with Meta. Data privacy laws like the GDPR and the CCPA/CPRA require businesses to implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to safeguard personal information.\\\\n\\\\nThese security obligations apply across the full data lifecycle — from collection to sharing. Any data processing agreement (DPA) you enter into with Meta should require Meta to apply the same security standards you use as a data controller.\\\\n\\\\nIf your business receives personal data from Meta, you’re responsible for protecting it just as you would any data you collect directly from users.\\\\n\\\\n### Be transparent with your users\\\\n\\\\nBelow is a non-exhaustive checklist of information the policy must include regarding your relationship with Meta.\\\\n\\\\n- Explain that you use Meta Business Tools, such as Facebook Pixel or Conversions API.\\\\n\\\\n- State your reasons for collecting and sharing data with Meta. For example, it may be used for ad targeting, analytics, or campaign measurement.\\\\n\\\\n- Disclose your use of Meta-related cookies and how users can manage or reject them through your site.\\\\n\\\\n- Inform users that data shared with Meta may be further shared by Meta, including with its partners or vendors.\\\\n\\\\n- Include links to Meta’s privacy and cookies policies.\\\\n\\\\n- Explain users’ rights under relevant laws and how they can exercise them, such as the right to object (under the GDPR) and the right to opt out (under the CCPA/CPRA).\\\\n\\\\n- If you use Meta ads for behavioral targeting, provide California users the option to opt out through a “Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Information” link.\\\\n\\\\n- If you rely on Facebook Page Insights, EU regulators treat you and Meta as joint data controllers. You should include a link to Facebook’s Page Controller Addendum and document this arrangement in your records of processing activities.\\\\n\\\\nMeta also requires that when you collect information from people who interact with your page, group, or event, you must first provide them with clear notice. Users must explicitly consent to your use of their data, and you must clearly explain that you, not Meta, are collecting and processing this information.\\\\n\\\\n### Take additional precautions when handling minors’ data\\\\n\\\\nMeta limits ad targeting for users under 18 to age and location only. Your business cannot circumvent these restrictions. For example, you must not use custom audiences based on lists known to include minors.\\\\n\\\\nIf your website or app is likely to attract minors, or if you collect data that could reasonably belong to users under 18, your business may be subject to heightened legal obligations. These requirements vary based on where your users are located and the nature of the data collected.\\\\n\\\\nThey include:\\\\n\\\\n- Obtaining verifiable parental consent under laws like the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the US, which must be separately obtained for collecting data and for sharing data\\\\n\\\\n- Obtaining explicit consent from a parent or legal guardian for minors under the age of 16, per GDPR requirements. EU member states can lower this to age 13\\\\n\\\\n- Using age verification mechanisms when age plays a role in data collection or eligibility for your services\\\\n\\\\nYour business must be prepared to meet these requirements if your data collection practices could involve users under the age of 18.\\\\n\\\\nUsercentrics does not provide legal advice, and information is provided for educational purposes only. We always recommend engaging qualified legal counsel or privacy specialists regarding data privacy and protection issues and operations.\\\\n\\\\n## Frequently asked questions\\\\n\\\\n### What data does Facebook collect?\\\\n\\\\nFacebook collects personal data that falls into several categories:\\\\n\\\\n- User-provided information, such as email, age, phone number, profile photo, and payment and delivery data\\\\n\\\\n- User activity, such as posts, likes, shares, messages, and ad interactions\\\\n\\\\n- App, browser, and device data, such as device type, GPS, IP address, and signal strength\\\\n\\\\n- Data from businesses that use Meta tools like the Meta Pixel or Conversions API, which may include pages viewed, purchases, and in-app actions\\\\n\\\\n### Is Facebook GDPR-compliant?\\\\n\\\\nFacebook states that it complies with the GDPR and other privacy laws, but your business is still responsible for meeting legal requirements when collecting and sharing personal data.

Summary\\\\n\\\\nHere are some activities that might qualify as \\\\\\\"collecting personal information\\\\\\\":\\\\n\\\\n- Recording the names or email addresses of your customers\\\\n\\\\n- Taking payments via a payment processor such as PayPal or Stripe\\\\n\\\\n- Using Facebook's Page Insights product\\\\n\\\\n- European Union: The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) places very strict data protection requirements on all businesses.\\\\n\\\\n- United Kingdom: EU privacy law still applies in the UK, so if you have UK customers you must also comply with the GDPR\\\\n\\\\nTake a look at this section of Facebook's Pages, Groups and Events Policies:\\\\n\\\\n### Your Contact Details\\\\n\\\\nYou should include full contact details for your business, including its legal name, business address, and email address.\\\\n\\\\nHere's an example from Product Hunt:\\\\n\\\\nNote that Product Hunt refers to itself as \\\\\\\"the Controller.\\\\\\\" This is only relevant if you have customers in the EU and have to comply with the GDPR. We'll discuss this in more detail below.\\\\n\\\\n### Personal Information You Collect\\\\n\\\\nWhether you're running a physical store, an ecommerce store, or online services business, you'll need to collect basic personal information such as customers' names and contact details.\\\\n\\\\nHere's an example from Bando:\\\\n\\\\nIf you have a broader online presence extending beyond your Facebook Page, you'll also need to explain the other ways in which you collect personal information.\\\\n\\\\nHere's an example from Microsoft:\\\\n\\\\n### How You Use Personal Information\\\\n\\\\nYou must explain your purposes for collecting personal information, i.e. how you use it.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, you can use your Facebook Page to enable customers to book appointments or make orders. Or you might use Facebook Messenger to engage with customers and receive inquiries.\\\\n\\\\nYou should have a clear business purpose for using any personal information you collect. If you collect email addresses, names, and shipping addresses, you must explain why you do this.\\\\n\\\\nHere's an example from catering business Chrissie Cakes and Supplies:\\\\n\\\\n### How You Share Personal Information\\\\n\\\\nHere's an example from ecommerce business Jasmin Studio Crafts:\\\\n\\\\nNote that you don't necessarily need to name the businesses with whom you share personal information: you can just identify the types of businesses.\\\\n\\\\n## If You Have Customers In the UK or EU\\\\n\\\\nIf you've ever visited a company's Facebook Page from within the UK or the EU (or the wider European Economic Area), you might have noticed a link reading \\\\\\\"Information about Page Insights data.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nClicking this link leads to a page explaining that Facebook and Facebook Page Admins are \\\\\\\"joint controllers\\\\\\\" under the GDPR.\\\\n\\\\nA German court required Facebook to create this policy based on how its \\\\\\\"Insights\\\\\\\" product works. Here's where to find Insights:\\\\n\\\\nThe Insights tool automatically collects data about who visits your Page. As a Page Admin, you would never be able to actually use this data to determine whether a particular individual had visited your page.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, according to the EU, this data is personal information. And under the GDPR, you and Facebook are jointly responsible for processing it.\\\\n\\\\n### Your Obligations Under Facebook's Page Insights Controller Addendum\\\\n\\\\nAs a Facebook Page Admin, you're held jointly responsible for Insights data. Facebook's Page Insights Controller Addendum sets the rules about how you and Facebook should meet your legal obligations.\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR allows joint controllers to decide among themselves how they will fulfill their legal obligations. Fortunately, Facebook has allocated almost all of the GDPR's duties to itself, and there's not much left for Page Admins to do.\\\\n\\\\nHere are Page Admins' duties under the Addendum:\\\\n\\\\n- Your legal basis for processing Page Insights data and the \\\\\\\"legitimate interests\\\\\\\" you are pursuing by using this data\\\\n\\\\n- The identity of your responsible data controller and their contact details\\\\n\\\\n- The identity of your Data Protection Officer (if you have one)\\\\n\\\\nFacebook doesn't explain what any of this means or how you can communicate it to your customers. That's where we come in.\\\\n\\\\n### Your Legal Basis and Legitimate Interests\\\\n\\\\nFacebook requires you to identify your legal basis for processing Page Insights data.\\\\n\\\\nThe concept of the \\\\\\\"legal basis\\\\\\\" (or \\\\\\\"lawful basis\\\\\\\") is very important under the GDPR.\\\\n\\\\nWe won't go into detail about the legal bases here. Essentially, there are six legal bases, and every time you collect personal information, you need to identify a legal basis for doing so.\\\\n\\\\nSo, what's your legal basis for receiving personal information from Page Insights? Well, Facebook suggests that it might be in your \\\\\\\"legitimate interests,\\\\\\\" which is one of the six legal bases.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\"Legitimate interests\\\\\\\" can be a suitable legal basis when you process personal information in a way that benefits your business without causing any significant privacy risks.

writer) and last updated on 01 July 2022.\\\\n\\\\nIf you operate a Facebook Page, both you and Facebook may need to follow the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Facebook has specific rules on how it splits GDPR responsibilities with Page administrators.\\\\n\\\\n- 1. GDPR Basics\\\\n\\\\n- 2. GDPR Controllers and Processors\\\\n\\\\n- 3. Facebook Page Insights and Personal Data\\\\n\\\\n- 4. Page Insights Controller Addendum\\\\n\\\\n- 5.1. Facebook Requirements\\\\n\\\\n- 5.1.1. Legal Basis\\\\n\\\\n- 5.1.2. Joint Controller Statement\\\\n\\\\n- 5.2. GDPR Requirements\\\\n\\\\n- 8. Summary\\\\n\\\\n## GDPR Basics\\\\n\\\\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Union regulation, meaning it has legal effect in every country that's a member of the EU.\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR applies to any personal data processing if:\\\\n\\\\n- The business that processes the data (or decides how it's processed) is in an EU country\\\\n\\\\n- The data subject (the person the data is about) is in an EU country, or\\\\n\\\\n- The data processing physically takes place in an EU country\\\\n\\\\n(Note that although the United Kingdom is no longer an EU country, it is currently scheduled to follow EU Regulations until the end of 2020. After that the same measures will still apply in the UK through domestic law until this law is revoked, amended or replaced.)\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR sets out a wide range of rules about personal data processing. The fundamentals are that:\\\\n\\\\n- It's only legal to process personal data in a limited range of circumstances, most commonly that the data subject has given meaningful consent or the processing is necessary for your legitimate interests.\\\\n\\\\n- Processing means any use of data, including collection and disclosure.\\\\n\\\\n- You must tell the data subject, in advance, the purpose or purposes for which you will process data.\\\\n\\\\n- You must inform the data subject again (and get fresh consent if appropriate) before processing the data for a new purpose.\\\\n\\\\n- The data subject has the right to know what data you store about them and whether you've disclosed it to a third party. They also have the right to correct errors and, in some circumstances, ask you to delete data.\\\\n\\\\n- You must adequately secure the data.\\\\n\\\\n## GDPR Controllers and Processors\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR holds two groups responsible for data processing.\\\\n\\\\n- Controllers decide what data is collected and how it is processed. They may also carry out the processing.\\\\n\\\\n- Processors carry out processing following the instructions of controllers.\\\\n\\\\nIn simple terms, both controllers and processors are responsible for complying with the GDPR, while controllers are also responsible for making sure processors working for them are complying with the GDPR.\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR also allows for the situation where two different controllers make decisions about processing the same data. As long as the same data is processed for the same purpose, the two are considered joint controllers.\\\\n\\\\nThis has important legal consequences. Ultimately both joint controllers are individually responsible for all the processing and could be individually responsible for paying compensation after a breach. However, the GDPR does allow the joint controllers to set out who will be in charge of complying with which specific GDPR requirements. This includes who will take responsibility for dealing with any complaints or any communication with regulators (known under the GDPR as supervisory authorities).\\\\n\\\\n## Facebook Page Insights and Personal Data\\\\n\\\\nFor the most part the data processing and GDPR situation with Facebook is simple. When individuals post on their own account or in groups, it is Facebook that is collecting and processing data and thus Facebook that is classed as the controller whenever that processing comes under the GDPR.\\\\n\\\\nThe situation is more complicated with Pages. These work in a similar way to a personal profile but cover an organization, business or brand. Rather than users becoming \\\\\\\"friends,\\\\\\\" users choose to \\\\\\\"like\\\\\\\" a page and can then see updates from it. Each Page is set up by a Facebook user who then acts as its administrator.\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR element comes into play because the administrator is able to access information about people who interact with the page. This information comes through a service called Page Insights which uses cookies to collect data about page interactions and users.\\\\n\\\\nThat created a legal argument that the Page administrator could be classed as a data controller because their decision to create the Page contributed to data being collected and processed.\\\\n\\\\nAs Facebook is also clearly a data controller in this context, it's down to Facebook and the Page administrator to determine whether they have joint controller status and how this will operate.\\\\n\\\\n## Page Insights Controller Addendum\\\\n\\\\nThe joint controller set-up is covered by the Page Insights Controller Addendum, which is part of Facebook's Pages, Groups and Events Policies. By creating a Page, you agree to this addendum and its position on joint controllers. In this context, \\\\\\\"Facebook\\\\\\\" means Facebook Ireland Limited.\\\\n\\\\nThe key points are as follows:\\\\n\\\\n- Facebook and the Page administrator are joint controllers in the case of data collected through Page events (that is, interactions with the Page) and then aggregated to provide it to the administrator through Page Insights.\\\\n\\\\n- The Page administrator is responsible for having a legal basis to process Insights Data.\\\\n\\\\n- Facebook is responsible for most other aspects of GDPR compliance, specifically: Facebook's own legal basis for processing data Informing data subjects about the collection and processing Handling the data subject's rights such as access, correction and deletion Making any notifications after a data breach\\\\n\\\\n- Facebook's own legal basis for processing data\\\\n\\\\n- Informing data subjects about the collection and processing\\\\n\\\\n- Handling the data subject's rights such as access, correction and deletion\\\\n\\\\n- Making any notifications after a data breach\\\\n\\\\nFacebook decides how to comply with its GDPR obligations.\\\\n\\\\nIf a Page Administrator receives a data access request regarding Page Insights data, they must not respond. Instead they must pass the request on to Facebook within seven days using this form:\\\\n\\\\n### Facebook Requirements\\\\n\\\\n#### Legal Basis\\\\n\\\\nFacebook requires you to tell users what your legal basis is for the collection and processing of data through Page Insights. (Remember that you are jointly responsible for such processing.)\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR sets out six allowable legal bases in Article 6:\\\\n\\\\n- Consent\\\\n\\\\n- Processing necessary to perform a contract\\\\n\\\\n- Processing necessary to comply with a legal obligation\\\\n\\\\n- Processing necessary to protect someone's vital interests\\\\n\\\\n- Processing necessary to carry out a task in the public interest or to exercise official authority\\\\n\\\\n- Processing necessary for the controller's legitimate interests\\\\n\\\\nPage visitors don't get enough information or give specific meaningful consent to make basis 1 suitable in most cases involving Page Insights. Bases 2 through 5 will rarely if ever apply to Page Insights.\\\\n\\\\nThis leaves basis 6, legitimate interests. For this basis to apply, you must go through a three point checklist:\\\\n\\\\n- What exactly is the legitimate interest?\\\\n\\\\n- Is the processing necessary to achieve this interest?\\\\n\\\\n- Do the individual's personal data rights and freedoms override this interest?\\\\n\\\\nNormally your access to Page Insights should meet these tests and thus legitimate interests is an acceptable legal basis.\\\\n\\\\nUsing Page Insights helps you learn more about your audience and thus improve and target the service and information you provide. The fact you can only access the information in aggregated form means it doesn't pose a serious risk or breach of privacy for an individual.\\\\n\\\\nRomantic Germany goes beyond simply stating it relies on \\\\\\\"legitimate interests\\\\\\\" and instead explains to users what this means:\\\\n\\\\n#### Joint Controller Statement\\\\n\\\\nLufthansa does this in a policy dedicated to its Facebook Page:\\\\n\\\\nBASF gives additional detail on what data is processed through Page Insights, listing specifics like your country of location, number of visits, gender relations, etc.:\\\\n\\\\n### GDPR Requirements\\\\n\\\\n- Your identity and contact details that of your data protection officer (if you have one)\\\\n\\\\n- What data you process\\\\n\\\\n- The purpose for processing\\\\n\\\\n- The legal basis for processing\\\\n\\\\n- How long you'll keep the data\\\\n\\\\n- Whether you share the data with anyone else\\\\n\\\\n- The user's rights to access data, correct it, and ask you to delete it\\\\n\\\\nGood Game Studios puts this information directly after the details of the Page Insights data processing:\\\\n\\\\n- Answer a few questions about your business:\\\\n\\\\n- Enter the country and click on the \\\\\\\"Next Step\\\\\\\" button:\\\\n\\\\nThe second is to make sure your identity and contact details are clearly listed in the About section of your Page. To avoid confusion, do so through the standard About field rather than posting it elsewhere on the Page, for example as a pinned post:\\\\n\\\\n## Summary\\\\n\\\\nLet's recap what you need to know and do to comply with the joint controller rules for Facebook Page Insights:\\\\n\\\\n- The GDPR applies if a data controller, a data subject, or the processing itself is in an EU country.\\\\n\\\\n- When the GDPR applies, the data controller must give the data subject details of what data is processed, how and why. They must have a legal basis to process the data.\\\\n\\\\n- A data controller is the person or organization that decides what data to process and how to do so. The GDPR allows for joint controllers of particular data. They share legal responsibility but can divide compliance tasks between them.\\\\n\\\\n- Facebook collects data about interactions with Pages and makes this data available to Page administrators through the Page Insight program.\\\\n\\\\n- Facebook's terms - which Page administrators must agree to - say that Facebook and the Page administrator are joint controllers for the Page Insight data.\\\\n\\\\n- Facebook agrees to handle most of the GDPR compliance tasks relating to the Page Insight data. It requires the Page administrator to take responsibility for having a legal basis for the data's processing. In most cases this will be \\\\\\\"legitimate interests.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n- Page users can make data access requests to the Page administrator, but the Page administrator must pass this on to Facebook within seven days. Facebook will handle the request.\\\\n\\\\n- Add their full contact details\\\\n\\\\n### About this article\\\\n\\\\nLast updated\\\\n\\\\nThis article was last updated on 01 July 2022.\\\\n\\\\nAuthor\\\\n\\\\nJohn Lister\\\\n\\\\nFreePrivacyPolicy Legal writer\\\\n\\\\nCategory\\\\n\\\\nDisclaimer\\\\n\\\\nPlease note that legal information, including legal templates and legal policies, is not legal advice.\\\\n\\\\n### Try out our free generators\\\\n\\\\nFree Cookie Consent\\\\n\\\\nFree Terms and Conditions Generator\\\\n\\\\nFree Cookies Policy Generator\\\\n\\\\nFree Disclaimer Generator\\\\n\\\\nFree EULA Generator\\\\n\\\\nFree Return & Refund Policy Generator\\\\n\\\\n### What our customers says\\\\n\\\\n— Anonymous\\\\n\\\\n— Andrea - Toronto Success Coach\\\\n\\\\nQuick and easy way to secure our company website.

Instagram warns users to be careful about what they share and communicate through their personal content.\\\\n\\\\nTo further protect users, the company is changing how data generated on their sites and apps are kept and shared.\\\\n\\\\nInstagram has always had account settings that allow you to control who can see and access your profile. But previously, when you employed third-party apps such as a web-based program to view your Instagram feed, you may have unwittingly agreed to make your photo content visible in search engines. Ad data shared with partners has demographic details in it, but it does not have personally identifying details.\\\\n\\\\nIf you choose to delete your Instagram account, your posts will vanish, but data shared by others isn’t considered part of your account.

There's lots of information in our Data Policy about the kinds of information we collect, with some examples and links to where you can learn more. But here are some of the categories of things we receive: the content you provide when you post, like or comment, your connections, your transactions, and your usage of our products. We also collect information that other people provide about you, like when they tag you in a photo. We also collect information from your device, such as identifiers, cookies, and information you can control using your device settings, including your camera, microphone and different kinds of location information, along with information from our partners, like websites you visit, apps you use or purchases you make.\\\\n\\\\nSharing Your Data\\\\n\\\\nData allows us to provide a personalized experience to different people, and to learn new things and improve our service. There's lots of information in our Data Policy about the ways we use the information we have, with some examples and links to where you can learn more. But here are some of the ways we use data:\\\\n\\\\n- People and accounts on Instagram, depending on the audience you choose, your settings, and the features you use. Remember that public information can be seen by anyone.\\\\n\\\\n- Services (like apps and websites) you choose to give access to your Instagram information, like if you use a service to see all your social media together. You can revoke their access to your information, here.\\\\n\\\\n- Advertisers. We help advertisers understand whether their ads are effective. We also share with companies that help to make reports for advertisers.\\\\n\\\\n- Companies that offer things through Instagram, like if you buy something and provide your shipping address.\\\\n\\\\n- Vendors and service providers we hire to help us with our business.\\\\n\\\\n- Researchers and academics, like to try to understand how to stop bullying and harassment online.\\\\n\\\\n- Legal requests (like from a court or law enforcement), when consistent with the law and our policies.\\\\n\\\\nHow To Access and Download Your Data\\\\n\\\\nA great first step to controlling your online data is to understand what you’ve shared. We offer tools to review the information we have for your account and the data you’ve shared on Instagram. You’ll see information we have about you, as well as your content, like your posts, comments, and messages. Learn how to use these tools in our Help Center.\\\\n\\\\nHow to Delete Your Data\\\\n\\\\nSometimes people change their minds about things they’ve shared online. To delete a photo or video that you've posted, tap above your post and then tap Delete. You can also archive posts to hide them from your profile and make it so your followers and other people on Instagram can't see it. But don’t worry—when you archive a post, it keeps all its likes and comments.\\\\n\\\\nYou can also temporarily disable or delete your account at any time. When you delete your account, we delete your posts, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Learn more.\\\\n\\\\nAnything that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted if you delete your account. But, if you are concerned about a picture or information someone else has posted about you, you can report it to us. See how “To report a post,” above.\\\\n\\\\n# Check out more announcements about Instagram\\\\n\\\\n- #ANNOUNCEMENTSEdit and Restyle Instagram Stories Using Meta AI\\\\n\\\\n#ANNOUNCEMENTS\\\\n\\\\n- #ANNOUNCEMENTSInstagram Teen Accounts Will Be Guided by PG-13 Ratings\\\\n\\\\n- #ANNOUNCEMENTSProtecting Teens & Schools: Instagram’s New Safety Programs\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"We cannot provide a description for this page right now\\\",\\n      \\\"source\\\": \\\"web\\\",\\n      \\\"price\\\": 0.0015,\\n      \\\"length\\\": 3710,\\n      \\\"image_url\\\": {\\n        \\\"0\\\": \\\"https://about.instagram.com/en-us/file/1185792132399708/share-image-2024.webp/\\\"\\n      },\\n      \\\"relevance_score\\\": 0.89382342678335,\\n      \\\"data_type\\\": \\\"unstructured\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"What You Must Include in an Instagram Privacy Policy\\\",\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://termly.io/resources/articles/instagram-privacy-policy/?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\\\",\\n      \\\"content\\\": \\\"By: Stefani Schmidt, M.S., CIPM, CIPP-US | Updated on: November 7, 2025\\\\n\\\\n- What Are Instagram’s Platform Policy Requirements?\\\\n\\\\n- Summary\\\\n\\\\n## What Are Instagram’s Platform Policy Requirements?\\\\n\\\\nLike all businesses, Meta also needs to follow applicable laws and regulations — something they seem to be struggling with if you look at this big list of massive GDPR fines.\\\\n\\\\n- Your policy must follow all applicable laws and regulations and accurately explain what data you process, how you process it, your purpose for doing so, and how users can request to delete that information.\\\\n\\\\n- It will not supersede, modify, or be inconsistent with the Meta terms.\\\\n\\\\n- You must retain all versions of your in-effect privacy policies and provide them to Meta if they ask.\\\\n\\\\n- You must ensure the links to your policy are always current and up to date.\\\\n\\\\nThe requirements continue further, with Meta describing additional rules for service and tech providers and outlining a long list of prohibited practices regarding data use.\\\\n\\\\nTo achieve full privacy compliance, it’s worth looking into these sections of their Platform Terms a little closer.\\\\n\\\\n### Rules for Service Providers and Tech Providers\\\\n\\\\nMeta’s additional rules for service and tech providers appear in Section 5 of their Terms.\\\\n\\\\nThere, they state that if you use any service providers, they must have a signed policy in place stating that they also agree to the Instagram Platform Terms before gaining access to any data.\\\\n\\\\nThe additional rules for tech providers mainly cover client-related information. It stipulates that all tech providers will use data solely for the specific purpose outlined by the client.\\\\n\\\\nTech providers are also subject to rules regarding client information, data sharing with clients, and client termination.\\\\n\\\\n### Prohibited Practices Regarding Data Use\\\\n\\\\nSome of the prohibited uses include:\\\\n\\\\n- Processing platform data to discriminate or encourage discrimination against others\\\\n\\\\n- Processing platform data to make eligibility determinations about people (like housing, employment, or education opportunities)\\\\n\\\\n- Processing platform data to perform or facilitate surveillance\\\\n\\\\n- Selling, licensing, or purchasing the data\\\\n\\\\n- Placing the data on a search engine or making it otherwise available\\\\n\\\\n- Decoding, circumventing, re-identifying, de-anonymising, or unscrambling the data in any way\\\\n\\\\n- Changing the functionality of your app or data processing so users view it as an unfamiliar or different app\\\\n\\\\n- Processing friends list from Facebook (also owned by Meta) to establish social connections in your platform, unless each person grants you access for that purpose\\\\n\\\\nTheir policy outlines additional restrictions regarding who you share the data with and your data retention, deletion, and accessibility options for consumers granted those rights by data privacy laws and regulations.\\\\n\\\\nThese laws impact businesses worldwide, and some have very broad thresholds, so chances are at least one applies to your business.\\\\n\\\\nWhile each piece of legislation is different, you’ll need to include the following information:\\\\n\\\\n- What personal data you collect\\\\n\\\\n- Why you collect the information\\\\n\\\\n- How you use it (aka, your legal basis)\\\\n\\\\n- Who you share it with or sell it to\\\\n\\\\n- What rights your users have over that data\\\\n\\\\n- How they can follow through on those rights\\\\n\\\\n- California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which amends some areas of the CCPA\\\\n\\\\n- California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)\\\\n\\\\n- Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA)\\\\n\\\\n- Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)\\\\n\\\\n#### Introduction\\\\n\\\\nIn this section, you introduce your business, explain who the terms of the policy apply to, and write clear definitions of phrases used throughout the agreement so your users’ expectations are properly set.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, this is where you would want to include your business’s physical address and even its complete legal entity name(s).\\\\n\\\\nSee an image of their introductory clause below.\\\\n\\\\n#### What Personal Data You Collect\\\\n\\\\nIn this section, list the categories of personal data you collect and process about your users, including any sensitive personal information.\\\\n\\\\nBe thorough and specific in this section to meet the Instagram Platform Terms and any additional legal requirements.\\\\n\\\\nAdobe has an excellent example of this clause, shown in the screenshot below.\\\\n\\\\n#### Why You Collect the Data and How it Gets Used\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re subject to laws like the GDPR or the CCPA, you must say why you collect the data and include your legal basis.\\\\n\\\\n#### Who You Share the Data With\\\\n\\\\nThis way, your users can read those third-party agreements and decide if they’re comfortable giving those entities access to their information.\\\\n\\\\nBelow, see how Adobe formats this clause in their privacy agreement.\\\\n\\\\n#### Internet Cookies\\\\n\\\\nUnder laws like the GDPR and CCPA, internet cookies qualify as personal data, plus most of these regulations give users the right to limit how their information gets used regarding analytics and advertising.\\\\n\\\\nAdobe includes a short paragraph with live links to their other policies, shown below.\\\\n\\\\n#### The Legal Rights of Your Consumers\\\\n\\\\nYou must list all rights your users have over their data if you’re subject to laws like the GDPR, CCPA, or the Virginia CDPA.\\\\n\\\\nYou can do this in one clause or separate it into policies specific to users in those unique areas.\\\\n\\\\n#### Information Regarding Children’s Data\\\\n\\\\nIf your services target children, you must follow additional requirements to process their information, like obtaining consent from their legal guardians.\\\\n\\\\n#### International Data Transfers\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR outlines specific guidelines regarding international data transfers.\\\\n\\\\nSome countries are approved for transfers because they follow the same safety standards mandated by the regulation.\\\\n\\\\nBut if you transfer to other places, including the US, you must ensure the third party signs an agreement stating they’ll abide by all the obligations, user rights, and data protocols required by the GDPR.\\\\n\\\\nBelow, read how Adobe phrases this clause in its policy.\\\\n\\\\n#### Safety and Security\\\\n\\\\nAdobe puts a short paragraph in its policy to meet this legal requirement, as shown below.\\\\n\\\\n- Use a managed solution\\\\n\\\\n- Try a free template\\\\n\\\\n- Do it yourself\\\\n\\\\nLet’s walk through these solutions so you can choose what’s best for you.\\\\n\\\\n### Managed Solution\\\\n\\\\nTo use it, you answer questions about your business, and it kicks out a compliant, properly formatted agreement that you can then link to your website or app.\\\\n\\\\nTermly’s product engineers and data privacy experts help ensure that all of the tools reflect the most recent data privacy laws and regulations, which often change.\\\\n\\\\nSee a screenshot of our generator below.\\\\n\\\\n### Free Template\\\\n\\\\nThese take more work on your end, as you’ll have to fill out blank sections of the agreement manually. But they still provide proper formatting, the most common clauses, and standardized language that typically appears in these legal policies.\\\\n\\\\nI recommend using a template if you don’t actually collect data from your users or if your data processing is minimal.\\\\n\\\\nBelow, you can see a screenshot of our free template.\\\\n\\\\n### Do-It-Yourself\\\\n\\\\n- Make your policy clear and freely accessible. People can’t be charged to access it.\\\\n\\\\n- Clearly define compliance rules, like age and content restrictions.\\\\n\\\\n- Clearly define what information you’ll access and how you’ll use it.\\\\n\\\\n- Explain how you’ll utilize user-generated content.\\\\n\\\\n- Tell users how you protect their data and what security measures are in place.\\\\n\\\\n- Include information on international privacy laws, like the GDPR and CCPA.\\\\n\\\\n- In the settings field in your App Dashboard\\\\n\\\\n- In the official listing of your app on any App Stores that allow you to do so\\\\n\\\\nBut for legal compliance under laws like the GDPR and CCPA, you should put a link to your agreement at or before the point of data collection.\\\\n\\\\nIt should also live in a static place on your website, like in the footer or within a specific privacy center, so consumers can easily find and read it.\\\\n\\\\nYou can manually add one of these pages to your own website. Or, if you use Termly, we’ll provide the URL for you. Either option works for both Instagram and legal compliance.\\\\n\\\\nBut by enforceable, I really mean compliant. Privacy policies are descriptions of your privacy collection practices intended to inform your users; it’s not a set of rules or directions your users must follow.\\\\n\\\\n- Ask them to select an unmarked checkbox to express that they’ve read and agreed to it\\\\n\\\\nThis second method is known as the browsewrap method or implied consent.\\\\n\\\\n## Summary\\\\n\\\\nInstagram privacy policies are required for any app or website that uses their API, even those that don’t collect personal data.\\\\n\\\\nThese policies must cover a variety of requirements, including what’s included in Meta’s Platform Terms and any laws or regulations that impact your business.\\\\n\\\\n##### More about the author\\\\n\\\\n#### Written by Stefani Schmidt, M.S., CIPM, CIPP-US\\\\n\\\\n- Termly vs Ketch: Comparing Features and Services Comparisons November 14, 2025Ali Talip Pınarbaşı, CIPP/E, & LLM\\\\n\\\\n##### Termly vs Ketch: Comparing Features and Services\\\\n\\\\nNovember 14, 2025Ali Talip Pınarbaşı, CIPP/E, & LLM\\\\n\\\\nNovember 7, 2025Hanna De La Garza\\\\n\\\\n- 5 Types of Legal Requirements for Ecommerce Stores Articles November 5, 2025Natasha Piirainen\\\\n\\\\n##### 5 Types of Legal Requirements for Ecommerce Stores\\\\n\\\\nNovember 5, 2025Natasha Piirainen\\\\n\\\\n- 14 Website Policies You Need and How To Make Them Articles October 15, 2025Hanna De La Garza\\\\n\\\\n##### 14 Website Policies You Need and How To Make Them\\\\n\\\\nOctober 15, 2025Hanna De La Garza\\\\n\\\\nOctober 15, 2025Natasha Piirainen\\\\n\\\\n- 5 Best GDPR WordPress Plugins for GDPR Compliance Articles October 15, 2025Natasha Piirainen\\\\n\\\\n##### 5 Best GDPR WordPress Plugins for GDPR Compliance\\\\n\\\\n- Clickwrap vs. Browsewrap Agreements and When To Use Them Articles October 15, 2025Natasha Piirainen\\\\n\\\\n##### Clickwrap vs. Browsewrap Agreements and When To Use Them\\\\n\\\\n- Do Not Track Disclosures Articles October 15, 2025Natasha Piirainen\\\\n\\\\n##### Do Not Track Disclosures\\\\n\\\\nExplore more resources\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Their policy outlines additional restrictions regarding who you share the data with and your data retention, deletion, and accessibility options for consumers granted those rights by data privacy laws and regulations.

Every photo. Every voice message. Fed into AI,\\\\\\\" the post read.\\\\n\\\\nThe claim was also spread on [Threads](https://www.threads.com/@hustlewithchip/post/DQscX-SAQJc) ([archived](https://archive.ph/PpDTq)) and prompted Snopes readers to search the site for the truth of it.\\\\n\\\\nMeta's planned privacy policy update on Dec. 16, 2025, does not pertain to direct messages and does not change how Meta handles them, though. The update instead will focus on how it uses data collected from conversations people have with Meta AI, the company's generative artificial intelligence (AI) app. We therefore rate this claim as false.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\"The update mentioned in the viral rumor isn't about DMs at all, it's about how we'll use people's interactions with our AI features to further personalize their experience,\\\\\\\" a Meta spokesperson told Snopes over email. \\\\\\\"We do not use the content of your private messages with friends and family to train our AIs unless you or someone in the chat chooses to share those messages with our AIs. This also isn't new, nor is it part of this Dec. 16 privacy policy update.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nOn Oct. 1, 2025, [Meta revealed](https://about.fb.com/news/2025/10/improving-your-recommendations-apps-ai-meta/) that it planned to update its privacy policy on Dec. 16. The incoming major change to the company's privacy policy, according to the news release, was that Meta would start using peoples' interactions with its generative AI features to personalize content and ad recommendations.\\\\n\\\\nFollowing the announcement, Meta kept both its [current privacy policy](https://archive.ph/nLWj7), last updated in June 2025, and its [upcoming privacy policy](https://archive.ph/BDgxu#1) on its website.\\\\n\\\\nIn both [current](https://archive.ph/nLWj7#selection-479.0-483.39:~:text=Messages%20you%20send%20and%20receive%2C%20including%20their%20content%2C%20subject%20to%20applicable%20law.%20On%20some%20Products%2C%20you%20can%20use%20end%2Dto%2Dend%20encrypted%20messages.%20Learn%20more%20about%20how%20end%2Dto%2Dend%20encryption%20works.) and [new](https://archive.ph/BDgxu#selection-475.0-479.39:~:text=Messages%20that%20you%20send%20and%20receive%2C%20including%20their%20content%2C%20subject%20to%20applicable%20law.%20On%20some%20Products%2C%20you%20can%20use%20end%2Dto%2Dend%20encrypted%20messages.%20Learn%20more%20about%20how%20end%2Dto%2Dend%20encryption%20works.) privacy policies, the section on that data Meta collects included the same passage about messages:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\"Messages that you send and receive, including their content, subject to applicable law. On some Products, you can use end-to-end encrypted messages.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAccording to [Meta's policies](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/1084673321594605), end-to-end encrypted messages cannot be read by Meta: \\\\\\\"End-to-end encrypted messages and calls ensure only you and the people you're communicating with can see or listen to what is sent, and no one else, not even Meta, can do so.\\\\\\\" Despite this policy, people can choose to [store encrypted messages remotely with Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/820525008940780) and Meta may read encrypted messages if one of the people in the conversation [reports a message](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/498828660322839?cms_platform=android-app&helpref=platform_switcher). When someone reports an encrypted message, recent messages from that conversation are forwarded and sent to Meta for review, according to the company's policies.\\\\n\\\\nAt the time Meta launched default encrypted messages on Messenger in December 2023, the company [wrote](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/12/default-end-to-end-encryption-on-messenger/#:~:text=nobody%2C%20including%20Meta%2C%20can%20see%20what%E2%80%99s%20sent%20or%20said%2C%20unless%20you%20choose%20to%20report%20a%20message), \\\\\\\"nobody, including Meta, can see what's sent or said, unless you choose to report a message.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nNot all messaging systems on Meta's platforms are encrypted. While Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp conversations are set to be encrypted by default, chats with Facebook groups, chats with businesses and Marketplace chats are [not encrypted](https://archive.ph/ulJzQ). According to Meta policy, the company may collect that data.\\\\n\\\\n#### Sources\\\\n\\\\nCrisan, Loredana. \\\\\\\"Launching Default End-To-End Encryption on Messenger.\\\\\\\" Meta, 7 Dec. 2023, about.fb.com/news/2023/12/default-end-to-end-encryption-on-messenger/.

Usually, they’re incredibly difficult to read. Research, [polling](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/), [reporting](https://themarkup.org/the-breakdown/2023/08/03/how-to-quickly-get-to-the-important-truth-inside-any-privacy-policy), and personal experiences [abound](https://iacis.org/iis/2022/2_iis_2022_138-149.pdf) on why privacy policies are so [bad](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/05/31/abolish-privacy-policies/) these days: [they are too long](https://lorrie.cranor.org/pubs/readingPolicyCost-authorDraft.pdf), [use legalistic and inaccessible terminology](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/12/opinion/facebook-google-privacy-policies.html), [are presented as take-it-or-leave-it](https://kb.osu.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/ff3341dc-dd6f-5fdf-920c-245521837c05/content), and [much more](https://kb.osu.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/d6692cd5-a08e-534e-9350-735fb279bce4/content). None of this is new information (although, it’s all still a serious and widespread problem).\\\\n\\\\nBut less attention is often paid to how privacy policies themselves are *displayed.*As someone who has spent a substantial amount of time reviewing these policies across countless companies and platforms, in my work researching commercial data practices, I’ve come to regard one company as perhaps the worst of the lot in how it visually presents its policies: Meta. Regulators and lawmakers should take note.\\\\n\\\\n## How did it get this way?\\\\n\\\\nThe 20-year-old, US-based multinational conglomerate founded by Mark Zuckerberg has [over three billion](https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2024/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2023-Results-Initiates-Quarterly-Dividend/default.aspx) daily active users worldwide and operates products and services ranging from Facebook and Instagram to WhatsApp, Oculus, and AI models such as Llama. Yet, understanding what the company is collecting, inferring, and purchasing, let alone doing with individuals’ data, is made even more challenging by the way Meta incomprehensibly lays out its privacy policy language.\\\\n\\\\nIt is, to say the least, a test to think of any company besides Meta that puts so much effort into breaking up its privacy policies into probably hundreds of indigestible pieces, scattered across numerous websites and pages, with confusing hyperlinks, circular references to documents, no ability to comprehensively and functionally search across documents, and misleading or inaccurate statements about what specific pages describe to the viewer. In other words: it’s a usability disaster.\\\\n\\\\nSearching “Meta privacy policy” online brings up a [page on Facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/) titled “What is the Privacy Policy and what does it cover?” It’s remarkably long. It’s broken up into many subsections. It’s difficult to search. It’s hard to navigate. And, at the time of this writing, that webpage alone had 168 links to various other webpages and pop-ups within the page.\\\\n\\\\nIf you click on just one of those, such as “[Review the privacy policies of the other Meta companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678),” it brings you to a page called “[The Meta Companies](https://web.archive.org/web/20241008070028/https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678)” which then links to terms for Meta Payments, Facebook Payments International, and more. When I clicked on the [EU privacy terms for Facebook Payments Limited International](https://web.archive.org/web/20240927014044/https://www.facebook.com/payments_terms/EU_privacy), it directed me to a page with no information on it that prompted me to log into a Facebook.com account. One page claims to tell you something useful and points to many other pages and popups, which also tell you you’ll get the information you want—if you just click one more hyperlink. It’s turtles all the way down.\\\\n\\\\nDesigning privacy information in this way makes it nearly impossible for the average user to understand what Meta does with respect to a specific product, service, or technology. Looking to learn what information is [collected and transmitted](https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/06/16/facebook-is-receiving-sensitive-medical-information-from-hospital-websites) via the Meta Pixel? If you’re hoping for a quick read, good luck. Meta breaks its Pixel documentation into numerous pages, and when you click on a link on the Pixel [Advanced Matching page](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel/advanced/advanced-matching) that claims to help you “learn what data is sent when using the Meta Pixel,” it directs you to the [general page](https://transparency.meta.com) for Meta’s Transparency Center. Now, we’re back where we started above, with numerous subsections and 168 links and pop-ups. Only by pulling together information from [many](https://web.archive.org/web/20241006044549/https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel/) [different](https://web.archive.org/web/20241003134755/https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel/implementation/conversion-tracking#custom-events) webpages is it possible for a user to even *see* all the information Meta posts about what data the Meta Pixel can transmit. (That’s before attempting to understand it.)\\\\n\\\\nTake another example. Maybe you’re concerned about Meta [saying](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/meta-will-start-collecting-anonymized-data-about-quest-headset-usage/) in February 2024 it would begin collecting what it called “anonymized” device usage data about Oculus headsets—at the same time as Meta [ended](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/4503393-meta-set-to-delete-all-oculus-account-data-by-end-of-march/) consumers’ ability to use an Oculus Quest headset without creating a Meta account or linking it to an existing one. Well, learning about that topic is a nightmare, too. The webpage for “[Legal Documents](https://web.archive.org/web/20240926134919/https://www.meta.com/legal/quest/)” about Quest devices links to dozens of different webpages, including a variety of “supplemental” policies and documents, that themselves have many links and subsections, again perpetuating the same design and layout problem. It would take hours just to pull together the information, before any work on consolidation and interpretation.\\\\n\\\\nMeta didn’t always display its privacy information this way. But over the years, the company (once eponymously known for its first product, Facebook) has presented its privacy policy in an [increasingly graphics-oriented format](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/13/facebook-updates-privacy-policy-data), riddled with drop-downs and buttons. The substance of that evolving set of privacy policies, as [pointed out](https://archive.epic.org/2014/12/facebook-revises-privacy-polic.html) by nonprofit groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center, has made clear the company has continued to collect and use individuals’ data without meaningful consent. Yet, the days when users could use a little CTRL+F or CMD+F magic to search for words within a page are in the rearview mirror. Meta’s design and display decisions have made answering basic questions—such as “what data does Meta gather via virtual reality headsets?” or “from which apps and services does Meta collect fine-grained geolocation data?”—virtually impossible for the average user. You can’t even attempt to understand what you can’t easily access in the first place. Given how much effort this confusing design must take, that might be Meta’s very objective.\\\\n\\\\n## It’s worse by comparison\\\\n\\\\nTo be very clear, Meta is hardly the only problematic actor when it comes to privacy policies. As described above, privacy policies are rife with length, complexity, and other issues. Many companies drown their privacy policies in words like “could,” “might,” or “may,” and while it might make for fun semantic debate in a law class, these hypotheticals don’t tell readers what companies are *actually doing* with data. They also intentionally leave the door open to companies doing anything they want with individuals’ data tomorrow or five years from now.\\\\n\\\\n#### Our Content delivered to your inbox.\\\\n\\\\nJoin our newsletter on issues and ideas at the intersection of tech & democracy\\\\n\\\\n#### Thank you!\\\\n\\\\nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list.\\\\n\\\\nThe privacy policy for Google, for example, is not the most accessible document in the world and [contains](https://iacis.org/iis/2022/2_iis_2022_138-149.pdf) many such hypothetical statements and privacy loopholes. It also has lots of vague language. But Meta stands out even from its data-hoarding competitors like Google and TikTok in just how badly it presents its “privacy policy” information—and just how difficult it is, should you have a specific question about a specific service or product, to find concrete information about what Meta does with your data.\\\\n\\\\n## Where are the regulators?\\\\n\\\\nAt a certain point, there should be consequences for designing the layout and presentation of privacy policies in completely unreasonably segmented, obfuscating ways. Perhaps it’s worth an inquiry into whether such practices violate the US [Federal Trade Commission Act](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/statutes/federal-trade-commission-act) and similar prohibitions on deceptive business practices. Legislators should prevent these bad practices in future privacy laws, too.\\\\n\\\\nThe FTC, for its part, has been clear in its [enforcement decisions](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/D%26O-InMarketMediaLLC.pdf) that companies should seek “affirmative express consent” from consumers before collecting and using their data. Doing so requires “clear and conspicuous disclosure” to consumers of the categories of data collected about them; the purposes of data collection, use, and disclosure; “a simple, descriptive URL (or hyperlink if technically possible) to a document that describes” this information; and “a simple, descriptive URL (or hyperlink if technically possible) to a simple, easily-located means by which the consumer can withdraw consent and that describes any limitations on the consumer’s ability to withdraw consent.” Otherwise, companies may be in violation of [Section 5 of the FTC Act](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/mission/enforcement-authority)—and its prohibition on unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\\\\n\\\\nMeta does not appear to clearly and conspicuously describe the data it collects about individuals. It does not have simple, descriptive URLs for these pages—in fact, any single privacy-related document on a Meta website could link to dozens or over 100 other pages and pop-ups that Meta purports provide additional information. Both of these points raise the question of whether Meta is deviating from practices the FTC has indicated are legally required.\\\\n\\\\nFurther, the FTC Act prevents deceptive practices in general—[defined](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/mission/enforcement-authority) by FTC [policy](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/410531/831014deceptionstmt.pdf) as “involving a material representation, omission, or practice that is likely to mislead a consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances.” If any number of pages on the Meta website that claim to provide consumers with information about privacy do not, in fact, provide and present said information in a reasonable manner (or, really, at all), it likewise raises the question of whether Meta might be violating the FTC Act by deceptively *designing* the layout of its privacy policy information.\\\\n\\\\nLawmakers working on privacy bills should not forget that substance *and* layout are important for privacy policies, to avoid these kinds of bad practices that bury information from consumers and regulators, further limit consumers’ ability to consent, and threaten individuals’ ability to exercise their privacy rights. New laws on privacy should require companies to make their privacy policies clearly laid out, on a single or just a few webpage(s), in an easily navigable and comprehensively searchable format. Regulators should also ask the question of whether certain kinds of presentations of privacy policies violate existing federal and state laws, introducing the need to investigate and potentially enforce compliance.\\\\n\\\\nWe’re long overdue for better laws, regulations, and technology practices for presenting data collection and use information to consumers. But in some cases, the design and presentation of privacy information is itself a serious problem—and Meta might just win the prize for “worst in show.”\\\\n\\\\n#### Related Reading\\\\n\\\\n- [Researchers Consider the Impact of Meta's CrowdTangle Shutdown](https://www.techpolicy.press/researchers-consider-the-impact-of-metas-crowdtangle-shutdown/) - [We Know a Little About Meta’s “Break Glass” Measures.

At Meta, we’ve always set out to build personalized experiences that provide value without compromising your privacy. So, it’s on us to have strong protections for the data we use and be transparent about how we use it. That includes communicating more clearly about our data practices and the choices you have.\\\\n\\\\nWe’re also including more ways to access controls you can use to experience our products in ways that are right for you. You can continue to manage your privacy settings at any time and we’re committed to letting you know if we make important changes to how we collect, use and share your information.\\\\n\\\\n## Responding To Feedback and Evolving Regulation\\\\n\\\\n## Privacy Center\\\\n\\\\nYou can think of Privacy Center as a hub for your privacy questions, where you can learn about how we use data, make use of some of the various privacy controls that we offer, and brush up on key account security tips and tools. We’ll also continue adding more guides and controls to it.\\\\n\\\\n## Updating Controls for Your Privacy\\\\n\\\\nNew Audience Controls: Starting today, we’re also rolling out a new setting to make it easier to manage who sees your posts on Facebook. Now, when someone selects a default audience, that audience selection will apply to new posts created in Facebook that they share to their timeline unless they select a different audience for a particular post. Previously, your default audience for posts matched whichever audience you chose most recently. So if you had just made a post that was available to the public, your subsequent posts would be as well. This new setting will help make sure you’re sharing with the right people in your community.\\\\n\\\\nNew Ways to Manage the Ads You See: Recently, we consolidated the Ad Topics and Interest Categories controls into a single control that can be accessed on Facebook and Instagram, covering a more extensive set of ad topics. This allows people to use a single control to set preferences across ad topics that reflect the interest targeting categories advertisers may use to reach them and the content they might see in an ad.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"We’ve added more detailed explanations in our Privacy Policy including about how we use and share information with third parties. And we’ve paired it with the Privacy Center and new controls to manage your experience, like who sees your posts and the topics you want to see ads about. Starting today, Meta is rolling out notifications letting people know that we’ve updated our Privacy Policy, formerly known as the Data Policy.\\\",\\n      \\\"source\\\": \\\"web\\\",\\n      \\\"price\\\": 0.0015,\\n      \\\"length\\\": 2367,\\n      \\\"image_url\\\": {\\n        \\\"0\\\": \\\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/CD22_040-NRP-Updated-Privacy-Policy-Header.jpg?w=1200\\\",\\n        \\\"1\\\": \\\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/CD22_040-NRP-Updated-Privacy-Policy-Header.jpg\\\",\\n        \\\"2\\\": \\\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/01_Updated-Meta-Privacy-Policy-1-1.jpg?resize=890%2C593\\\",\\n        \\\"3\\\": \\\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/02_Privacy-Policy-Update_5-things-1.jpg?resize=890%2C1236\\\",\\n        \\\"4\\\": \\\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/plugins/post-media-zip/assets/downloadicon_arrowimg.png\\\"\\n      },\\n      \\\"relevance_score\\\": 0.871625686339034,\\n      \\\"data_type\\\": \\\"unstructured\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Privacy Policy | Meta Open Source\\\",\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://opensource.fb.com/legal/privacy/?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\\\",\\n      \\\"content\\\": \\\"Effective April 25, 2023\\\\n\\\\n- use of open source code, documentation or specifications made available on GitHub, which are governed by the terms of the applicable open source license;\\\\n\\\\n- pull requests, issues and any other interactions or features related to participation in open source projects on GitHub, which are governed by GitHub's terms and conditions; or\\\\n\\\\n- use of any other Meta website, service or product, which are governed by the terms and conditions applicable to those offerings.\\\\n\\\\n#### What Kinds of Information Do We Collect?\\\\n\\\\nWhen you interact with us through our Services, we may collect or receive the following types of information:\\\\n\\\\nInformation you provide directly to us.

When you or others use third-party services or other Meta Company Products that are integrated with our Services, those third-party services may receive information about what you or others share with them. For example, if you use a data backup service integrated with our Services (like iCloud or Google Account), they will receive information you share with them, such as your WhatsApp messages. If you interact with a third-party service or another Meta Company Product linked through our Services, such as when you use the in-app player to play content from a third-party platform, information about you, like your IP address and the fact that you are a WhatsApp user, may be provided to such third party or Meta Company Product.

No one else, not even WhatsApp, can read or listen to them.\\\\n\\\\nBack to top\\\\n\\\\n### WhatsApp Legal Info\\\\n\\\\nRespect for your privacy is coded into our DNA. Since we started WhatsApp, we've aspired to build our Services with a set of strong privacy principles in mind.\\\\n\\\\n### Information We Collect\\\\n\\\\nThe types of information we receive and collect depend on how you use our Services. We require certain of Your Account Information in accordance with our Terms to deliver our Services and without this we will not be able to provide our Services to you. For example, you must provide your mobile phone number to create an account to use our Services.\\\\n\\\\nOur Services have optional features which, if used by you, require us to collect additional information to provide such features. You will be notified of such a collection, as appropriate. If you choose not to provide the information needed to use a feature, you will be unable to use the feature. For example, you cannot share your Precise Location Information with your contacts if you do not enable location sharing on your device. Permissions can be managed through your device-based settings on both Android and iOS devices.\\\\n\\\\n### Information You Provide\\\\n\\\\n- Your Account Information. You must provide your mobile phone number and a profile name of your choice to create a WhatsApp account. If you don’t provide us with this information, you will not be able to create an account to use our Services. You can add other optional information to your account, such as a profile picture, and \\\\\\\"about\\\\\\\" information.\\\\n\\\\n- Your Messages, Media within Messages, and Calls: We offer end-to-end encryption for our Services. End-to-end encryption means that your calls, messages, media within messages including content like images, audio, video, documents and files are encrypted to protect against third parties (including WhatsApp) from seeing that content. Learn more about end-to-end encryption and how businesses communicate with you on WhatsApp.Typically your messages are stored on your device(s) and not on our servers. We temporarily store your messages in encrypted form while they are being delivered. Once your messages are delivered, they are deleted from our servers. If a message cannot be delivered, we keep it in encrypted form on our servers for up to 30 days while we try to deliver it. If a message is still undelivered after 30 days, we delete it. We cannot see the contents of undelivered messages stored on our servers as they are encrypted. When a user sends media within a message, we store that media for up to 30 days in encrypted form on our servers to aid in more efficient delivery, such as if recipients choose to forward the media. We cannot see the media as it is encrypted.\\\\n\\\\n- Status Information. You can choose to share your Status, which is also end-to-end encrypted.\\\\n\\\\n- You may also provide content that is not encrypted which means that we can see it. This includes your profile picture, your \\\\\\\"about\\\\\\\" information and names and descriptions of your communities and groups.\\\\n\\\\n- Your Connections. You can use contact upload and provide us with the phone numbers in your device address book on a regular basis, including those of users of our Services and your other contacts. If any of your contacts aren’t yet using our Services, we’ll manage this information in a way that is designed to ensure that those contacts cannot be identified by us.

WhatsApp receives information about bad actors and abuse from Meta Companies and app verification information from anti-abuse services to promote safety, security and integrity. For example, when Meta becomes aware of a scam encouraging individuals to contact a phone number via WhatsApp, they might share that phone number with WhatsApp so we can investigate the WhatsApp account. We also allow you to use our Services in connection with third-party services and Meta Company Products. If you use our Services with such third-party services or Meta Company Products, we may receive information about you from them; for example, if you use the WhatsApp share button on a news service to share a news article with your WhatsApp contacts, groups, or broadcast lists on our Services.

If you interact with a third-party service or other Meta Company Products through our Services, such as when you use the in-app player to play content from a third-party platform like YouTube or Facebook, information like your IP address and technical information showing that the request comes from a WhatsApp app, may be provided to the provider of such service or products.

They can't hear you yet (allegedly encrypted chats) but they can see everything else: what you eat, where you shop, they browse through your trash, look into the parcels you receive, can see who visits you (their names, addresses, etc), what apps do you use, how much is on your credit card.All this can be profiled, compared to the other millions and enriched with probable other details, e.g. if 100mln others bought a bucket and a shovel, when you buy a bucket you definitely want a shovel too. When 1000 people with the same details as you are criminals, than you are most likely a criminal too.\\\\n\\\\n*Upvotes: 472*\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Read More: WhatsApp Has Shared Your Data With Facebook for Years, Actually ...

DO NOT EDIT. ======================================================\\\\n\\\\nthis file is generated from src/style.less\\\\n\\\\nOpinionThe Privacy Project Google’s 4,000-Word Privacy Policy Is a Secret History of the Internet By Charlie Warzel and Ash Ngu Illustrated by Rose Wong\\\\n\\\\nThe late 1990s was a simpler time for Google. The nascent company was merely a search engine, and Gmail, Android and YouTube were but glimmers in the startup’s eye. Google’s first privacy policy reflected that simplicity. It was short and earnest, a quaint artifact of a different time in Silicon Valley, when Google offered 600 words to explain how it was collecting and using personal information.\\\\n\\\\nThat version of the internet (and Google) is gone. Over the past 20 years, that same privacy policy has been rewritten into a sprawling 4,000-word explanation of the company’s data practices.\\\\n\\\\nThis evolution, across two decades and 30 versions, is the story of the internet’s transformation through the eyes of one of its most crucial entities. The web is now terribly complex, and Google has a privacy policy to match.\\\\n\\\\nGoogle’s Privacy Policy Over Time 1999 Google is sensitive to the privacy concerns of its users. The Internet allows individuals to explore and communicate with unprecedented ease, but it also allows websites to collect and distribute personal information with equal ease. We at Google know that many users are, understandably, concerned about such practices, and we wish to make clear our policy for collecting and using personal information. Google’s Policy Google’s policy on our wholly controlled and operated Internet sites is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. Google does not willfully disclose individually identifiable information about its customers to any third party without first receiving that customer’s permission. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it. Google may share information about users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we only talk about our users in aggregate, not as individuals. For example, we may disclose how frequently the average Google user visits Google, or which other query words are most often used with the query word “Microsoft.” From time to time, there may be situations where Google asks you for personal information. When we intend to use your personal information, we tell you up front. This way you can decide whether you want to give us the information or not. In case you change your mind or some personal information changes, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us. Google and Cookies Upon your first visit to Google, Google sends a “cookie” to your computer. A cookie is a file that identifies you as a unique user. It can also store personal preferences and user data. A cookie can tell us, “This is the same individual who visited Google two days ago” but it cannot tell us, “This person is Joe Smith” or even, “This person lives in the United States.” Google uses cookies to track user trends and patterns, in order to better understand our user base and to improve the quality of our service. Google may also choose to use cookies to store user preferences. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of Google may not function properly if you refuse cookies. Links to Other Sites The page that comes up after “clicking” on a result URL is likely to be outside the Google site and beyond our control. Other links, such as for the Google-friends mailing list archive, are also on sites not controlled by Google. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Google may choose to exhibit its search results in the form of a “URL redirecter.” When a URL redirecter is used, whenever you “click” on a URL from a search result, information about the “click” is sent to Google, which then sends you to the site you clicked on. Google uses this URL information to understand and improve the quality of Google’s search technology. For instance, Google uses this information to determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results. Google’s policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Google’s control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. We reserve the right at our discretion to make changes to this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. 2009 At Google we recognize that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by Google Inc. or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies except DoubleClick (DoubleClick Privacy Policy) and Postini (Postini Privacy Policy); collectively, Google’s “services.” In addition, where more detailed information is needed to explain our privacy practices, we post supplementary privacy notices to describe how particular services process personal information. These notices can be found in the Google Privacy Center. Google adheres to the US Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement, and is registered with the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor Program. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us through our website or write to us at Privacy Matters c/o Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, California, 94043 USA Information we collect and how we use it We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information to us, such as Google Search. In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information: Information you provide – When you sign up for a Google Account or other Google service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password). For certain services, such as our advertising programs, we also request credit card or other payment account information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers. We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other Google services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information. Cookies – When you visit Google, we send one or more cookies – a small file containing a string of characters – to your computer or other device that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, improving search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends, such as how people search.

We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually. Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data. Information security We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

Accessing and updating personal information When you use Google services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users’ personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services. Enforcement Google regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy.

You can also choose to browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used. To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us. INFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls. When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions. When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information. Things you create or provide to us When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services.

We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request. We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and which apps you've installed.

Go to Google Account Your location information We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions for your weekend getaway or showtimes for movies playing near you. Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by: GPS IP address Sensor data from your device Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Google’s Policy Google’s policy on our wholly controlled and operated Internet sites is to respect and protect the privacy of our users.

We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\\\\n\\\\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\\\\n\\\\n# Why Google collects data\\\\n\\\\n## We use data to build better services\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\\\\n\\\\n### Provide our services\\\\n\\\\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\\\\n\\\\n### Maintain & improve our services\\\\n\\\\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\\\\n\\\\n### Develop new services\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\\\\n\\\\n### Provide personalized services, including content and ads\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\\\\n\\\\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\\\\n\\\\nGo to My Ad Center\\\\n\\\\n### Measure performance\\\\n\\\\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\\\\n\\\\n### Communicate with you\\\\n\\\\n### Protect Google, our users, and the public\\\\n\\\\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\\\\n\\\\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\\\\n\\\\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.\\\\n\\\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\\\\n\\\\n# Your privacy controls\\\\n\\\\n## You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\\\\n\\\\nGo to Privacy Checkup\\\\n\\\\n## Managing, reviewing, and updating your information\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.\\\\n\\\\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:\\\\n\\\\n### Privacy controls\\\\n\\\\n### Activity Controls\\\\n\\\\nDecide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Activity Controls\\\\n\\\\n### Ad settings\\\\n\\\\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. You can modify your interests, choose whether your personal information is used to make ads more relevant to you, and turn on or off certain advertising services.\\\\n\\\\n### About you\\\\n\\\\nManage personal info in your Google Account and control who can see it across Google services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to About You\\\\n\\\\n### Shared endorsements\\\\n\\\\nChoose whether your name and photo appear next to your activity, like reviews and recommendations, that appear in ads.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Shared Endorsements\\\\n\\\\n### Sites and apps that use Google services\\\\n\\\\nManage information that websites and apps using Google services, like Google Analytics, may share with Google when you visit or interact with their services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services\\\\n\\\\n### Ways to review & update your information\\\\n\\\\n### My Activity\\\\n\\\\nMy Activity allows you to review and control data that’s saved to your Google Account when you’re signed in and using Google services, like searches you’ve done or your visits to Google Play.

You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.\\\\n\\\\n- Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\\\\n\\\\n# Sharing your information\\\\n\\\\n## When you share your information\\\\n\\\\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.\\\\n\\\\n## When Google shares your information\\\\n\\\\nWe do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:\\\\n\\\\n### With your consent\\\\n\\\\nWe’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.\\\\n\\\\n### With domain administrators\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account.

We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.\\\\n\\\\n- Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.\\\\n\\\\n- Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public.\\\\n\\\\nWe may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.\\\\n\\\\n# Keeping your information secure\\\\n\\\\n## We build security into our services to protect your information\\\\n\\\\nAll Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.\\\\n\\\\nWe work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:\\\\n\\\\n- We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit\\\\n\\\\n- We offer a range of security features, like Safe Browsing, Security Checkup, and 2 Step Verification to help you protect your account\\\\n\\\\n- We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems\\\\n\\\\n- We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it.

You can also delete activity information saved in your account, or choose to have it deleted automatically after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.\\\\n\\\\n- Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as advertising data in server logs.\\\\n\\\\n- We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.\\\\n\\\\n- And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.\\\\n\\\\n# Compliance & cooperation with regulators\\\\n\\\\n## Data transfers\\\\n\\\\nWe maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data.\\\\n\\\\nWhen we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.\\\\n\\\\n## U.S. state law requirements\\\\n\\\\nSome U.S. state privacy laws require specific disclosures.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain the categories of information Google collects and the sources of that information in Information Google collects.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain the purposes for which Google collects and uses information in Why Google collects data.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain when Google may disclose information in Sharing your information. Google does not sell your personal information. Google also does not “share” your personal information as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\\\\n\\\\n- We explain how Google retains information in Retaining your information. You can also learn more about how Google anonymizes data. As described there, when Google anonymizes data to protect your privacy, we maintain policies and technical measures to avoid re-identifying that information.\\\\n\\\\nU.S. state privacy laws also provide the right to request information about how Google collects, uses, and discloses your information. And they give you the right to access your information, sometimes in a portable format; correct your information; and to request that Google delete that information. Many of these laws also provide the right to opt out of certain forms of profiling and targeted advertising.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy.

The first time you turn on Location History — which is off by default — your auto-delete option will be set to 18 months by default. Web & App Activity auto-delete will also default to 18 months for new accounts. This means your activity data will be automatically and continuously deleted after 18 months, rather than kept until you choose to delete it.

If you do not agree to these Terms, then do not access or use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms.”\\\\n\\\\nThe wording here includes a sentence that’s currently buried further down in the terms, making it clear that by using its apps, you are indeed agreeing to these terms.\\\\n\\\\nThe update also includes more specific explanations around misuse of Meta’s apps, and the scraping of data from them.\\\\n\\\\n“You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data you do not have permission to access, regardless of whether such automated access or collection is undertaken while logged-in to a Facebook account.”\\\\n\\\\nThat last sentence has been added, clarifying that you can’t use the fact that you were logged into Facebook as an excuse for data scraping. This distinction, between logged in and logged out access, has been used in the legal defense of some scraping cases.\\\\n\\\\nThere’s also a new explanation about circumventing Meta’s protection measures, and how that’s also a no-no.\\\\n\\\\nMeta’s also included some specific qualifiers on avatar and AI use, based on its separate agreements for each:\\\\n\\\\n“If you use Avatars, then the Avatar Terms also apply. If you use our AI products and features, the Meta AI Terms also apply. To the extent any supplemental terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAs noted, the references to its separate Avatar and Meta AI terms here are new, ensuring that these documents, which already exist, are also specifically noted within the initial user agreement.\\\\n\\\\nMeta’s Avatar and AI terms cover the use of your personal data inputs for these elements, including, say, selfie videos for avatar creation, or the sharing of your conversations with Meta’s AI tools with third parties.\\\\n\\\\nWhy would Meta need to share your AI chats? Well, it might need to pass on your query to Google or Bing to get search results from the web, though the terms also cover any internal reviews of your AI prompts and other usage.\\\\n\\\\nSo there’s a range of things that you’re agreeing to, which are not new, as such, but are now being more explicitly built into Meta’s usage agreements.\\\\n\\\\nOn its Community Standards, Meta’s not actually updating the document, but it is merging its Community Standards that cover Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and Threads into one central location for easier access.\\\\n\\\\nSo if you see this new prompt, now you’ll know what it is you’re agreeing to.\\\\n\\\\n- purchase licensing rights\\\\n\\\\n### Social Media Today news delivered to your inbox\\\\n\\\\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\\\\n\\\\n- Retrieved from Daniel Oberhaus/Wikimedia Commons on April 18, 2022 Tracker The Complete Elon Musk–Twitter Saga For months, we’ve been tracking Elon Musk’s $44 billion deal with Twitter.

This publication represents our company’s views on AI and creativity.\\\\n\\\\n--\\\\n\\\\nDid you get an email from the Zuck this morning? I did and if you’re one of the billions still roaming around the social network that defined so much of our modern perspective, you should really read up on the changes.\\\\n\\\\nBut who in the world has time for that? So, my friend ChatPDF and I are here to help. Yes, this is what we at Credtent.org call an AI-Assisted piece of content because I used ChatPDF to help analyze the update and find some bugaboos that might be worth a second look. This is what I often tell people — use AI to help protect yourself against AI.\\\\n\\\\nLet me disclose clearly that I am not an attorney and this is NOT legal advice. It’s just what a read of the TOS changes means from both an AI’s analysis and my own personal take on this coming from the perspective of someone whose life and work (as Credtent’s founder) is focused on making sure content creators are protected in the Age of AI. I’d note that ChatGPT’s Canvas helped me organize my thoughts as well, but I’ve rewritten most of its output because I’m a writer, not an #AISlacker. Still, this qualifies as AI-Assisted Content because I used AI as my collaborator.\\\\n\\\\nNow, with the disclosures out of the way, here’s the meat of the article.\\\\n\\\\nBelow, you’ll see an outline of what’s changing, what it means for you, and why you might want to reconsider your relationship with the platform. Sound like a good time? No, not really. But I hope this proves easier than parsing the legalese yourself.\\\\n\\\\n## What’s Changing?\\\\n\\\\nHere’s a breakdown of the major updates compared to the existing terms:\\\\n\\\\n- Data Usage: Facebook emphasizes that it doesn’t sell personal data but uses it extensively to deliver targeted ads and sponsored content. They also admit to leveraging advanced technologies (hello, AI!) for “research and development”. What could go wrong there?\\\\n\\\\n- Legacy Contacts: You can now appoint someone to manage your account posthumously. This sounds convenient and, to be honest, I’ve found it painful to see the occasional suggestion of a friend who I know has passed. But it opens the door to new privacy concerns, post-mortem.\\\\n\\\\n- Unilateral Terms Updates: By simply using the platform, you consent to any future changes. In other words, your agreement is automatic — whether or not you like the changes. If you stay on FB, you don’t need to accept terms — you’re opting in automagically.\\\\n\\\\n- Content Rights: Facebook retains broad rights over content you upload, including intellectual property. While it’s unclear how far this stretches, it raises questions about whether your creative work could be appropriated for purposes like AI training to produce work based on your own. We’ve already seen how FB content has been used in advertising without compensation or credit. This could get much worse.\\\\n\\\\n## Concerns for Content Creators\\\\n\\\\nIf you create content, Facebook’s new terms should raise a bright red flag. Here’s why:\\\\n\\\\n- AI Training Ambiguity: Meta admits to using AI and machine learning but stops short of specifying whether your content is used for training purposes. This lack of transparency leaves creators vulnerable to their work being exploited. Based on the past history of this and, frankly, most technology platforms, I’d be inclined to not trust this omission as being innocent.\\\\n\\\\n- Intellectual Property: While you retain ownership of your content, Facebook’s broad license to “use” it creates a gray area. What stops them from repurposing your video or photo for marketing campaigns — or worse, feeding it into an AI model to allows for creation of content that is competitive to your own?\\\\n\\\\n- Control Erosion: By continuing to use the platform, you implicitly are agreeing to future terms, giving Facebook a blank check to rewrite the rules as they see fit. Again, what could go wrong? We can’t know!\\\\n\\\\n## What’s at Stake for All Users\\\\n\\\\nEven if you’re not a content creator worried about your work being used against your future success, there’s still plenty to worry about:\\\\n\\\\n- Privacy: Meta claims it protects user privacy, but vague language about data analysis and AI leaves you wondering how much of your information is truly secure.\\\\n\\\\n- Account Management: Accounts can be (and have been) disabled (by Meta) for unclear violations. What happens to years of uploaded content if you’re suddenly locked out? This already happened to me once because of a scam. I tried to contact support but Meta made it nigh impossible to do anything about it — although scammers kept writing to me saying they could restore it for a fee. That’s some excellent customer service, huh?\\\\n\\\\n- Transparency: The absence of clear disclosures about AI training practices sets a dangerous precedent for big tech. If Facebook doesn’t explicitly outline its policies, who will? This is a bigger deal than you might think if you’re posting all kinds of pictures of yourself, your children, and your home.\\\\n\\\\n## Long-Term Repercussions\\\\n\\\\nSticking with Facebook post-2025 might begin to feel like maintaining access to a popular party or tribe while sacrificing your autonomy. The long-term risks include:\\\\n\\\\n- AI Entrapment: Your creative content could be mined to improve AI tools, with no opt-out clause. Imagine contributing to technology that competes with or devalues your own work. That said, Credtent.org IS sending opt-out requests to Meta for registered Credtent users. The legal fight over this dicey policy is coming so we’re preparing users for it.\\\\n\\\\n- Data Monopoly: The more data Facebook collects, the stronger its grip on user behavior and advertising markets. Users could face fewer alternatives as competitors struggle to keep up. Worse, how much (and how often) will Facebook sell their information to adtech and data brokers that can extrapolate a lot about you from your behavior. However much information you think is out there about you, let me be blunt — it’s 10X worse.\\\\n\\\\n- Legal Precedents: If unchecked, Facebook’s practices may influence other platforms to adopt similar, creator-unfriendly terms. I can’t imagine anybody wanting BlueSky, Medium and other sensible platforms to edge into these terms over time because we were just accepting them getting worse and worse.\\\\n\\\\n## What Should You Do?\\\\n\\\\nHere are some actionable strategies to start today to better protect yourself:\\\\n\\\\n- Diversify Platforms: Share your work on platforms like BlueSky, which explicitly refuses to train on user content, or Medium for long-form writing. This is what I am doing now. I’m also on Substack, although you need to directly opt-out of their use of your work for AI training.\\\\n\\\\n- Minimize Uploads: Use Facebook to post links to your external content rather than uploading original files directly. FB’s algorithm dings you for outbound links but it’s probably worth it in the end.\\\\n\\\\n- Monitor Updates: Keep an eye on Meta’s future changes and reconsider your use of the platform as needed. If it’s still worth it to you, have at it. For me, the camel’s back was broken years ago. I’m just getting tired of the pile of straw gathering on the poor thing.\\\\n\\\\n- Advocate for Regulation: Push for transparency and ethical AI practices in the tech industry. Your voice matters. Join Credtent.org to help fight back against unethical AI theft of your person and content.\\\\n\\\\n## Now is time to say goodbye to Meta\\\\n\\\\nMeta’s new terms make one thing clear: Using Facebook in 2025 comes with a huge knot of strings attached. Whether you’re a content creator or just someone who values privacy, now is the time to rethink your digital footprint. The platform may remain convenient (and “free” unless you’re an advertiser), but the cost — measured in rights and data — is higher than ever.\\\\n\\\\nFor me, I’m reducing my footprint to just posting links to my personal work elsewhere.

WE EXPLAIN SOME EXCEPTIONS AND HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION BELOW.\\\\n\\\\n1. MPT Products. Meta offers a variety of hardware and software products and services related to or in connection with those products as part of Meta Platforms Technologies. The hardware, services, features, apps, technologies, and software that are subject to these terms include the Meta VR Products and other Meta Platform Technologies products listed here, which may be updated from time to time (“MPT Products”).\\\\n\\\\n1.1. Accounts. We want our platform to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to agree to a few requirements before you can create an account to use our MPT Products:\\\\n\\\\n1.1.a. You must be at least 13 years of age to create one or more accounts supported by a MPT Product, such as a Meta account. You may create a Meta account on behalf of your child ages 10 to 12. When your child turns 13, they will have 30 days to start managing their Meta account or they will be blocked from using their device. Meta accounts for children ages 10 to 12 may not be supported on all MPT Products, including Meta Wearable Products.\\\\n\\\\n1.1.c. You may use the same Meta account to access different MPT Products, or you may create multiple different Meta accounts. However, except between you and your child ages 10 to 12 for whom you have created an account, you may not share passwords or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission).\\\\n\\\\n1.1.d. You must provide us with accurate and up to date information (including registration information), which may include providing your or your child’s personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone you aren’t.\\\\n\\\\n1.2. Meta Company Products. We may make certain Meta Company Products available for use on MPT Products. You may need to add your Meta account and other account types (such as a Facebook or Instagram account) to the same Accounts Center in order to access certain features or services offered by Meta Company Products (for example, you may need to add your Meta account to the same Accounts Center as your Facebook account in order to share content from a MPT Product on Facebook). If you choose to use these Meta Company Products, your use of them is subject to the relevant terms and conditions, including minimum age requirements, for those Meta Company Products (including relevant data policies).\\\\n\\\\n2. Your Commitments to Meta and Our Community\\\\n\\\\n2.1. Your responsibility for your use of MPT Products. You may only use MPT Products for personal non-commercial purposes unless otherwise expressly permitted in these Supplemental Terms or authorized by us in writing. Except as expressly permitted by us, you may not copy, modify, prepare directive works, distribute, sell, lease, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast, hack, emulate, or otherwise exploit any part of our services and software. Unless we are prohibited from restricting you under applicable law, you also may not reverse engineer any of the MPT Products or try to derive any of the software used in the MPT Products. You are also responsible for complying with all applicable laws when using MPT Products, including providing any notice to or obtaining any consents from other individuals who you interact with on your MPT Products as may be required under video recording, audio recording, biometric data, or other privacy or data protection laws. You are responsible for using your MPT Products in a safe, lawful, and respectful manner. For example, you may not tamper with the MPT Products, or otherwise obscure or modify any features that are intended to signal to others that the product is recording.\\\\n\\\\n2.3. Your responsibility for other users of your MPT Product. Each person, including you, who uses your MPT Product is referred to in these Supplemental Terms as a user of such products. You are responsible for the activities of all users of your MPT Products, and for their consent to and compliance with these Supplemental Terms. We encourage you to monitor others who use your MPT Products.\\\\n\\\\n2.4. Your responsibility for your child’s use of a Meta account to access MPT Products. You are responsible for determining that your child is ready to use MPT Products, consistent with the Health and Safety Warnings (see 5.5.d). If your child is below 10 years of age or otherwise not ready to use MPT Products as determined by you, you must not create an account for them. You are responsible for the activities of your child when they use a Meta account to access MPT Products, and for their compliance with these Supplemental Terms. You are responsible for supervising your child’s access to and use of MPT Products. You are responsible for ensuring your child understands these Supplemental Terms as well as other Terms and Policies that may apply, such as the Code of Conduct for Virtual Experiences, and ensuring they understand how to behave and interact with others when accessing MPT Products.\\\\n\\\\n3. The Permissions You Give Us\\\\n\\\\n3.3. Permission to use your name, profile picture, and information about your actions with ads and sponsored or commercial content. You give us permission to use your profile name, profile picture, and information about actions you have taken in MPT Products (for example, apps you use) next to or in connection with ads, offers, and other sponsored or commercial content that we display in MPT Products without any compensation to you. Additionally, if you choose to connect your Meta account with other Meta Company Products accounts (such as your Facebook or Instagram accounts), you also give us permission to display your profile information and information about actions you have taken in MPT Products across Meta Company Products. Ads and content like this can be seen only by people who have your permission to see the actions you've taken in MPT Products consistent with your privacy settings.\\\\n\\\\n4. What You Can Share and Do on MPT Products\\\\n\\\\n4.1. Permission to use. If your MPT Product includes software applications, content, or virtual items other than Third-Party Services (“Software and Content”) that have been enabled for your use, we hereby grant you a personal, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited right and license to access, use, and download (as permitted by the functionality of the MPT Products) that Software and Content on MPT Products devices you own or control, solely for personal non-commercial purposes (except as expressly authorized by Meta in writing), conditioned on your compliance with these Supplemental Terms. Any unauthorized use of the MPT Products, including the Software and Content, is strictly prohibited and will cause the license granted in these Supplemental Terms to terminate automatically. No licenses or rights are granted to you by implication or otherwise, except for the licenses and rights expressly granted to you herein or in any other applicable terms. The Software and Content are the property of Meta, its affiliates, or its licensors, and are only licensed, not sold to you. Meta also requires that you use only the then-current version of the Software and Content.\\\\n\\\\n4.2. Third-Party Services. MPT Products can be used to access software, applications, services, content, and virtual items (including, but not limited to, third-party digital content, additional or enhanced functionality, or media content purchased through MPT Products) provided by third parties (“Third-Party Services”). In some cases, Meta or its affiliates may distribute Third-Party Services to you on behalf of the third party.\\\\n\\\\n4.2.a. Third-Party Terms. Your use of a Third-Party Service may be subject to additional terms, conditions, fees, and policies imposed by the third party (together, “Third-Party Terms”). Meta is not a party to these Third-Party Terms. However, in the event that Third-Party Terms conflict with the provisions of these Supplemental Terms, these Supplemental Terms will govern. You are responsible for complying with any applicable Third-Party Terms, and we recommend that you review any applicable Third-Party Terms before using Third-Party Services. We have no obligations or liability for (i) your access to or use of any Third-Party Services, (ii) any information that you provide or authorize us to provide to any Third-Party Services, or (iii) such third party’s collection, use, or disclosure of such information. If you have connected to a Third-Party Service on a MPT Product, you may remain connected using saved credentials unless you take action to discontinue access to that service (such as by changing the applicable account settings for the relevant Third-Party Service).\\\\n\\\\n4.2.b. Default End User License. If you are not presented with an end user license agreement when you acquire Third-Party Services, the following license terms apply to your use of such Third-Party Services: (a) the third party providing the Third-Party Services (and not Meta or its affiliates) is the licensor of such Third-Party Services; (b) such third party grants you a limited, non-transferable license to access and use the Third-Party Services only for your personal and non-commercial purposes; and (c) you may not modify, decompile or disassemble the Third-Party Services in whole or in part, or create any derivative works from or sublicense any rights in or to the Third-Party Services, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the third party or as permitted under applicable law notwithstanding these restrictions. Meta and its affiliates are not parties to the license agreement between you and the provider of such Third-Party Services or other Third-Party Terms.\\\\n\\\\n4.2.c. Discontinuation of Third-Party Services. Third-Party Services may require access to data about Meta users and Meta services, which access is subject to agreements between Third-Party Service providers and Meta. We may disable this access for a Third-Party Service if the Third-Party Service provider breaches these agreements, our policies, or applicable law, or if the agreements are otherwise terminated. This may adversely affect your use of such Third-Party Services, including by making such Third-Party Services partially or fully inoperable. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we will have no liability to you for removing or disabling access to data and services by a third party for these reasons. This means, without limitation, that Meta will not provide you with any refunds for such Third-Party Services in these cases. Any rights, including refund claims, which you may have under your agreements with third parties remain unaffected.\\\\n\\\\n4.4. Objectionable Content. We may display age, comfort, and content ratings for digital content (including ads) that are based on information provided to us by the developers of such content, and which are not verified by Meta, unless expressly mentioned. We cannot guarantee that digital content ratings will always be accurate, nor can we promise that you will not find some material harmful, inappropriate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable, including material that may be found through accessing third-party links or other Third-Party Services. You understand that you may be exposed to content from a variety of sources when using MPT Products and acknowledge that content may be inaccurate, inappropriate, offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable. You agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Meta will not be responsible or liable for content posted by you, other users of MPT Products, or a third party.\\\\n\\\\n4.5. Age Restrictions. You may only access certain digital content if you are of or above the age displayed to you when you order the digital content. If we determine that you did not comply with these age requirements, we may disable your access to the digital content and we will not refund the amounts paid for the digital content.\\\\n\\\\n5. Additional Provisions\\\\n\\\\n5.1. Functionality may change or be limited. We work constantly to improve MPT Products and respond to changing needs of our community. As part of this continual improvement, we may introduce new features or services, impose limits on, change, suspend, disable, remove, replace, update, upgrade, roll back, or restrict access to features, services, software, content or any part of MPT Products (including Meta Products or Meta Company Products). If a feature, service, software or content is no longer available, or if a technical error occurs, information, data, or content created or provided by you in connection with such feature, service, software or content may be deleted or become inaccessible, and you should not exclusively rely on any feature, service, software or content to store or preserve such information, data or content. In addition, certain features, services, software or content may be disabled or made available in modified form based on your age or location. We may offer free trials or other limited versions of the MPT Products so that you can preview these products before purchase. These versions may have limited features, restrict the permitted time of use and contain other limitations. The features, functionality, or availability of a Third-Party Service may change or be discontinued, including if the developer of such Third-Party Service violates our terms or policies, or in accordance with the Terms or the applicable Third-Party Terms.\\\\n\\\\n5.3. Updates to these Supplemental Terms. These Supplemental Terms may be updated from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices, to promote a safe and secure experience on the MPT Products, and/or comply with applicable law. Unless the changes are required by law, we will notify you before we make changes to these Supplemental Terms or any Commercial Terms (if the changes are applicable to the MPT Products used by you), and give you an opportunity to review the updated terms before they go into effect. We hope that you will continue using MPT Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Supplemental Terms, you must cease use of MPT Products. Your continued use of MPT Products after the effective date of the updated Supplemental Terms constitutes your acceptance of those terms.\\\\n\\\\n5.4. Third-Party Fees and Costs. You are responsible for the fees, costs, and other charges, such as internet usage or utilities fees, associated with use of MPT Products, as well as fees, costs, and other charges associated with Third-Party Services.\\\\n\\\\n5.5. Disclaimers; Limitations of Liability; Indemnification.\\\\n\\\\n5.5.b. Unless a separate limited warranty is provided, certain hardware products of the MPT Products are covered by the Limited Warranty offered by Meta Platforms Technologies, LLC. Nothing in these Supplemental Terms is intended to either abridge or expand the scope of those limited warranties.\\\\n\\\\n5.5.c. Certain MPT Products may have communication or calling capabilities. However, there are important differences between such MPT Products and a mobile or fixed-line telephone service. MPT Products do not provide access to emergency services or emergency service providers (including the police, fire departments, or hospitals), or otherwise connect to public safety answering points. You should ensure you can contact your relevant emergency service providers through a mobile telephone, fixed-line telephone, or other service.\\\\n\\\\n5.5.d. THERE ARE IMPORTANT HEALTH AND SAFETY WARNINGS, INFORMATION, AND INSTRUCTIONS (“HEALTH AND SAFETY WARNINGS”) THAT YOU MUST READ BEFORE USING MPT PRODUCTS OR ALLOWING YOUR CHILD TO USE MPT PRODUCTS, AVAILABLE HERE. THESE INCLUDE WARNINGS, INFORMATION, AND INSTRUCTIONS THAT A PARENT OR GUARDIAN MUST REVIEW AND CONSIDER BEFORE DETERMINING THAT THEIR CHILD IS READY FOR MPT PRODUCTS AND SETTING UP AN ACCOUNT ON THEIR BEHALF. WARNING: FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE HEALTH AND SAFETY WARNINGS AND INSTRUCTIONS MAY RESULT IN DAMAGE TO MPT PRODUCTS OR ACCESSORIES, AND MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, DISCOMFORT OR OTHER POTENTIAL HAZARDS. BY USING MPT PRODUCTS, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE REVIEWED THESE WARNINGS AND INSTRUCTIONS AND ENSURE THAT ALL USERS OF YOUR MPT PRODUCTS READ AND UNDERSTAND THE HEALTH AND SAFETY WARNINGS AND INSTRUCTIONS (AND WILL REVIEW ANY UPDATES THERETO), AND WILL ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH WARNINGS AND INSTRUCTIONS.\\\\n\\\\n5.5.e. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold harmless Meta and its affiliates from and against all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your purchase or use of the MPT Products; (ii) your actual or alleged breach of these Supplemental Terms or any other applicable terms, policies, warnings or instructions provided by Meta or a third party in relation to the MPT Products; (iii) your violation of any applicable law or any rights of any third party; (iv) any content you provide, upload, or transmit while using MPT Products, or (v) any access to or use of MPT Products by any third party to whom you have made available MPT Products access or use. In the event that you provide Meta’s defense to such a claim, you agree that Meta (a) shall be consulted regarding, and shall have the right to approve (at our sole discretion), defense strategy, any appeal, and any settlement of the claim, (b) shall have the right to select defense counsel, and (c) may further participate in the defense of the claim with counsel of our own choice at our own expense.\\\\n\\\\n5.6. Dispute Resolution.\\\\n\\\\nPLEASE READ THIS SECTION 5.6 CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT. THIS SECTION 5.6 REQUIRES YOU TO SUBMIT TO BINDING ARBITRATION ANY AND ALL DISPUTES (EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR BELOW) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS, OR ANY PERSONAL USE OF MPT PRODUCTS, AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.a. What claims must be arbitrated. Except as provided below, you and Meta agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or dispute between you and Meta arising out of or related to these Supplemental Terms, or the purchase or personal use of MPT Products (“claim(s)”) must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. By agreeing to arbitrate, you and Meta expressly waive the rights to sue in court and trial by jury. Our past, present, and future affiliates and agents, as well as any of our successors and assigns, can invoke our rights under this agreement in the event they become involved in a dispute.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.b. What claims won’t be arbitrated. Instead of using arbitration, you or Meta can bring claims in your local “small claims” court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don’t bring your claims in small claims court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. In addition, only a court may decide claims to enforce your or Meta’s intellectual property rights (like copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets) or resolve issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision or whether subsection 5.6.c (requiring individual arbitration), subsection 5.6.d (requiring pre-arbitration notice of disputes), or subsection 5.6.f (regarding coordinated arbitrations) have been violated. Moreover, nothing in these Terms will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief from us on your behalf.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.c. Arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and class arbitrations are not permitted; for example, you may bring a claim only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other users of MPT Products. Nor may an arbitrator consolidate arbitrations unless all parties agree. If there is a final judicial determination that the limitations of this paragraph are unenforceable as to a particular claim or a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief), then that claim or request for relief will be decided by a court after all other claims and requests for relief are arbitrated.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.d. Notice of claims before arbitration. Before you or Meta commence arbitration of a claim, the claimant must provide the other party with a written Notice of Dispute that includes your username, the claimant’s name and contact information, a detailed description of the dispute, the specific relief sought, and the claimant’s signature. If you send the Notice, it also must include your residence address (and mailing address if different), the email address and mobile phone number you use with your account, and if you are represented by an attorney, a signed statement authorizing Meta to discuss your account and share your confidential account information with your attorney. Any Notice of Dispute you send to Meta should be mailed to Meta Platforms, Inc., ATTN: MPT Arbitration Filing, 1 Meta Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025 (“Notice Address”). Before Meta commences arbitration, Meta will send you a Notice of Dispute to the email address you use with your account or when you access MPT Products or by other appropriate means. If you and we are unable to resolve a dispute within 60 days after a fully complete Notice of Dispute is received, you or Meta may commence arbitration, but neither party may commence an arbitration during this 60-day period. If any aspect of the requirements in this subsection have not been met, a court can enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations. In addition, unless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration provider cannot accept or administer the arbitration, nor assess any fees for such an arbitration. If the arbitration already is pending, it must be dismissed.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.e. How arbitration works. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by this arbitration provision. The AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules are available at https://www.adr.org or by writing to the Notice Address. If the AAA cannot or will not administer the arbitration in accordance with this arbitration provision, another arbitration provider will be selected by the parties or, if there is no agreement, by the court. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, unless the arbitrator determines that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel. The arbitrator may consider rulings in other arbitrations involving other claimants, but an arbitrator’s ruling will not be binding in proceedings involving different claimants. Except as provided in subsection 18.3, the arbitrator can award the same relief that a court can award under applicable law, including sanctions against any represented party or counsel permitted under the AAA rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), or other applicable federal or state law.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.e.1. Costs of arbitration. Meta will pay all AAA or arbitrator fees for any arbitration Meta brings. If you are assessed any such fees for any arbitration you bring, we will pay those fees on your behalf, so long as you have fully complied with subsections 5.6.c, 5.6.d, and 5.6.g and your claims seek relief valued at less than $75,000. In all cases, the arbitrator may reallocate these fees in accordance with the AAA’s rules regarding frivolous or improper claims or vexatious litigation.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.f. Arbitration of coordinated claims. If 25 or more claimants submit similar Notices of Dispute or file similar arbitrations and are represented by the same or coordinated counsel (regardless of whether the cases are pursued simultaneously), all of the cases must be resolved in arbitration in staged proceedings. You agree to this process even though it might delay the arbitration of your claim. In the first stage, claimants’ counsel and Meta will each select up to 25 cases (50 cases total) to be filed in arbitration and resolved individually by separate arbitrators. If feasible, arbitrators will be from the respective claimants’ home states.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"As stated in the Meta Terms of Service, we don’t sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don’t share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission.\\\",\\n      \\\"source\\\": \\\"web\\\",\\n      \\\"price\\\": 0.0015,\\n      \\\"length\\\": 24990,\\n      \\\"image_url\\\": {},\\n      \\\"relevance_score\\\": 0.8150897883604115,\\n      \\\"data_type\\\": \\\"unstructured\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Meta Platforms Technologies Products Commercial Terms | Meta Store\\\",\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.meta.com/legal/quest/commercial-terms/?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\\\",\\n      \\\"content\\\": \\\"Meta Platforms Technologies Products Commercial Terms\\\\n\\\\nIf you are an individual engaged in any commercial use of a MPT Product, you represent and warrant that you are not doing so as an individual consumer.

You acknowledge that Meta is not obligated to provide or make available any information related to an individual user’s personal accounts to an entity associated with the user.\\\\n\\\\nExcept as expressly authorized herein or with our written consent, you (a) are not permitted to make any MPT Products available for secondary commercial use by third parties and (b) shall not engage in any commercial resale or rental of any MPT Products. You may make your Meta VR Products available to third party customers (“Customers”) in connection with your commercial use of Meta VR Products for location-based experiences, arcades, trainings, or demonstrations (each, an “Extended Use”), provided that you will:be responsible for all Customer access and use of the Meta VR Products; separately obtain any necessary permissions or licenses to any Third-Party Services that you permit to be used with the Meta VR Products in the Extended Use; collect and set the fees (if any) you charge to Customers, including any sales, value-added or other taxes as required by applicable law; ensure the proper maintenance of the premises where the Extended Use takes place by, at least, keeping the premises clean (if applicable), providing sufficient space for optimal use of the Meta VR Products, keeping the Meta VR Products clean and in good working order, and ensuring that the Meta VR Products are regularly charged; prior to allowing Customers to use the Meta VR Products, provide a video or some other “proper use” training that instructs Customers on the proper use of the Meta VR Products and sufficiently warns about balance and other safety-related issues; provide to Customers all content-specific warnings for Third-Party Services that you use in your Extended Use, including any warnings provided by the Third-Party Service provider; provide to Customers accurate and complete disclosures that comply with applicable law regarding the privacy and security of any data collected, used, stored, transferred, or processed by you in connection with your Customers’ use of any software or experiences that you provide and of the Meta VR Products, which at a minimum will include the following disclosures: That you will collect, use, and have access to data about a Customer’s end-users for the purposes of provisioning, managing and monitoring the Customer’s use of Meta VR Products or other software and experiences you provide, and for providing support to Customer; and Meta is not responsible for the collection, use, storage and disclosure of data by you related to Customer’s use of Meta VR Products or other software and experiences you provide. follow all health and safety warnings provided by Meta with or in connection with the use of the Meta VR Products.\\\\n\\\\nYou are responsible for ensuring that the privacy settings for use of a MPT Product are satisfactory to you and to each individual user of the MPT Product.\\\\n\\\\nExcept as expressly authorized herein or with our written consent, you may not use or take any actions to use Meta VR Product devices with any apps or other software that: (i) disable, override or otherwise alter the Meta VR Product devices’ operating system, any system-level features or other system behavior; (ii) contain any features, functionalities or other elements that could confuse users regarding the distinction between (1) such apps or software and (2) the system-level software, settings or controls for the applicable Meta VR Product device (for example, by mimicking any system-level feature, or introducing any feature that users would reasonably expect to be a system-level feature); (iii) suppress user access to Meta health and safety warnings, information or instructions, terms of service, privacy policies, notices or disclosures, codes of conduct, or other terms, policies, notices or similar items, including those available to users through device settings or as included in device setup or feature enablement user flows; or (iv) use developer accounts or developer test accounts for purposes other than the development of applications in accordance with the Meta Quest Developer Policies and Meta Platform Technologies SDK License Agreement.\\\\n\\\\nTo the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, except for the limited warranties set forth in Section 9 of these MPT Commercial Terms, (i) MPT Products are provided “as is” for commercial use and we make no representations or warranties about commercial use of MPT Products; (ii) we make no representations or guarantees that MPT Products always will be safe, secure, or error-free, or that it will function without disruptions, delays or imperfections; (iii) we expressly disclaim any liability for any commercial use, whether of a MPT Product dedicated solely to commercial use or of a MPT Product used both for commercial and personal uses; and (iv) we also DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, ORAL OR WRITTEN, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

Nothing in these MPT Commercial Terms or the Supplemental Terms is intended to either abridge or expand the scope of that Limited Warranty. NOTE: YOUR COMMERCIAL USE OF META PLATFORMS TECHNOLOGIES PRODUCTS DOES NOT PROVIDE YOU ENTERPRISE-LEVEL WARRANTY AND SUPPORT SERVICES, WHICH MAY OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE FOR EXISTING META VR PRODUCTS OR MPT PRODUCTS.To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold harmless Meta and its affiliates, its and their independent contractors and service providers, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, “Meta Parties”), from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or in any way connected with (a) your purchase or use of, or inability to use, the MPT Products, (b) your violation of any applicable law or any rights of any third party, (c) any actual or alleged breach by you (or by any third party to whom you made available access or use of the MPT Products) of the Terms or any other applicable terms, policies, warnings, or instructions provided by Meta or a third party in relation to the MPT Products, (d) any use of a MPT Product in violation of applicable law, or any distribution, transfer, or export of a MPT Product, by you and any other user of the MPT Products, (e) any content you provide, upload, or transmit via Meta Products, and (f) any access to or use of the MPT Products by any third party to whom you have made available access or use of the MPT Products.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim any responsibility for any High Risk Use of MPT Products, and disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness of MPT Products for a High Risk Use.\\\\n\\\\nYou agree to arbitrate any claim, cause of action, or dispute between you and Meta that arises out of or relates to these MPT Commercial Terms or your commercial use of the MPT Products (“Commercial Claim”). This provision does not cover any commercial claims relating to (i) violations of your or our intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, copyright infringement, patent infringement, trademark infringement, violations of the Brand Usage Guidelines, violations of your or our confidential information or trade secrets, or (ii) efforts to interfere with MPT Products or engage with MPT Products in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). If a Commercial Claim between you and Meta is not subject to arbitration, you and Meta agree that such claim must be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County, and that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that Meta, in its sole discretion, may bring any claim it has against you related to efforts to abuse, interfere, or engage with MPT Products in unauthorized ways in any competent court in the jurisdiction in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the claim.We and you agree that, by entering into this arbitration provision, all parties are waiving their respective rights to a trial by jury or to participate in a class or representative action. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING COMMERCIAL CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING. For example, you may bring a Commercial Claim only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other parties. If there is a final judicial determination that any particular Commercial Claim (or a request for particular relief) cannot be arbitrated according to the limitations of this Section, then only that Commercial Claim (or only that request for relief) may be severed and brought in court. All other Commercial Claims (or requests for relief) will remain subject to this Section. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. All issues are for an arbitrator to decide, except that only a court may decide issues relating to the scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision or the interpretation of the prohibition of class and representative actions. If any party intends to seek arbitration of a dispute, that party must provide the other party with notice in writing. This notice of dispute to us must be sent to the following address: Meta Platforms, Inc., 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025. The arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”), as modified by these MPT Commercial Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. If the AAA is unavailable, the parties will agree to another arbitration provider or the court will appoint a substitute. The arbitrator will not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations in which you are not a party. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any evidentiary submissions made in arbitration will be maintained as confidential in the absence of good cause for its disclosure. The arbitrator’s award will be maintained as confidential only to the extent necessary to protect either party’s trade secrets or proprietary business information or to comply with a legal requirement mandating confidentiality. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA Rules, except that we will pay for your filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your Commercial Claim for damages does not exceed USD $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If you do not wish to be bound by this provision (including its waiver of class and representative claims), you must notify us as set forth below within 30 days of the first acceptance date of any version of these MPT Commercial Terms containing an arbitration provision (we note, for clarity, that the date on which you make your first commercial use of a MPT Product pursuant to these MPT Commercial Terms will constitute such acceptance date). Such notice to us must be submitted to the address here: Meta Platforms, Inc., 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025. All Commercial Claims between us, whether subject to arbitration or not, will be governed by California law, excluding California’s conflict of laws rules, except to the extent that California law is contrary to or preempted by U.S. federal law.\\\\n\\\\nThese MPT Commercial Terms may be updated from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices. If changes to these MPT Commercial Terms would adversely impact your commercial use of MPT Products or your responsibilities under these MPT Commercial Terms, we will notify you before we make such changes and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. We may also notify you in advance regarding other changes to these MPT Commercial Terms where required to do so by applicable law. We hope that you will continue using MPT Products, but if you do not agree to our updated MPT Commercial Terms, you must cease commercial use of MPT Products, and, if you are an entity, cause your employees and representatives to do the same.

The policy is valid from data acquisition and collection by the ONS, and it also extends through the lifecycle up to and including data archiving and data disposal.\\\\n\\\\nThis policy applies to all UK Statistics Authority and ONS employees, including staff on fixed-term, temporary or permanent contract, staff on secondment, students and contractors.\\\\n\\\\nMetadata provide information about other data, including a description of the data. This includes information that provides context to the data (for example, how it was collected), or the coverage of the data (for example, publication date, description and search keywords).\\\\n\\\\nThe ONS needs to hold and manage a comprehensive set of unambiguous metadata relating to the data it manages, in order to understand the data, fully extract the value from the data and employ appropriate security measures to protect the data.\\\\n\\\\nThe ONS Data Strategy specifies data principles for managing data; data policies support the implementation of these principles. This metadata policy aligns with the data principles and underpins the management and governance of metadata in the ONS. The metadata must comply with the data principles.\\\\n\\\\nMetadata provide information about other data and are essential in aiding understanding of the data and ensuring that appropriate security measures are employed to protect the data. Metadata will be defined and centrally maintained for all data held by the ONS from acquisition to dissemination, archiving and disposal.\\\\n\\\\nAll data acquired and collected by the ONS from external and internal sources must be accompanied by metadata. The ONS Metadata Model defines the minimum set of metadata that must accompany all data acquired by the ONS. In practice, captured metadata will go beyond the defined minimum set of metadata. In order to provide a framework for managing metadata, metadata categories have been defined and all metadata will be categorised according to these categories.\\\\n\\\\nONS Information assets held on the Information and Data Asset Register will be assigned a Metadata Owner, in addition to the Information Asset Owner. The Metadata Owner will periodically review the quality of the metadata they own and will initiate corrective action to address any issues found with the accuracy and quality of the metadata.\\\\n\\\\nThe ONS Business Glossary holds definitions for the main terms used within the ONS. Glossary Term Owners are appointed at the time of data acquisition, creation or amendment, and are responsible for maintaining their terms, updating and consolidating them with other terms as appropriate.\\\\n\\\\n1.

We don't allow apps with misleading, improperly formatted, non-descriptive, irrelevant, excessive, or inappropriate metadata, including but not limited to the app's description, developer name, title, icon, screenshots, and promotional images. Developers must provide a clear and well-written description of their app. We also don't allow unattributed or anonymous user testimonials in the app's description. Your app title, icon, and developer name are particularly helpful for users to find and learn about your app. Don’t use emojis, emoticons, or repeated special characters in these metadata elements. Avoid ALL CAPS unless it is part of your brand name. Misleading symbols in app icons are not allowed, for example: new message dot indicator when there are no new messages and download/install symbols when the app is not related to downloading content. Your app title must be 30 characters or less. Don’t use text or image in the app title, icon, or developer name that indicate store performance or ranking, price or promotional information, or that suggests relations to existing Google Play programs. In addition to the requirements noted here, specific Google Play Developer Policies may require you to provide additional metadata information.\\\\n\\\\n## Examples of common violations\\\\n\\\\n① Unattributed or Anonymous User testimonials ② Data comparison of apps or brands ③ Word blocks and vertical/horizontal word lists\\\\n\\\\n① ALL CAPS although not part of brand name ② Special character sequences that are irrelevant to the app ③ Use of emojis, emoticons(including kaomojis), and special characters ④ Misleading symbol ⑤ Misleading text\\\\n\\\\n- Images or text that indicate store performance or ranking, such as 'App of the year,' '#1,' 'Best of Play 20XX,' 'Popular,' award icons, etc. - Images or text that indicate price and promotional information, such as '10% off,' '$50 cash back,' 'free for limited time only,' etc. - Images or text that indicate Google Play programs, such as 'Editor’s choice,' 'New,' etc.\\\\n\\\\n#### Here are some examples of inappropriate text, images, or videos within your listing:\\\\n\\\\n- Imagery or videos with sexually suggestive content. Avoid suggestive imagery containing breasts, buttocks, genitalia, or other fetishized anatomy or content, whether illustrated or real. - Using profane, vulgar, or other language that is inappropriate for a general audience in your app’s Store listing. - Graphic violence prominently depicted in app icons, promotional images, or videos. - Depictions of the illicit usage of drugs. Even EDSA (Educational, Documentary, Scientific, or Artistic) content must be suitable for all audiences within the store listing.\\\\n\\\\n#### Here are a few best practices:\\\\n\\\\n- Highlight what's great about your app. Share interesting and exciting facts about your app to help users understand what makes your app special. - Make sure that your app’s title and description accurately describe your app’s functionality. - Avoid using repetitive or unrelated keywords or references. - Keep your app’s description succinct and straightforward. Shorter descriptions tend to result in a better user experience, especially on devices with smaller displays. Excessive length, detail, improper formatting, or repetition can result in a violation of this policy. - Remember that your listing should be suitable for a general audience.

People from whom you collect content or information must explicitly consent to your use of their data. You must clearly explain that you (and not Meta) are collecting this data.\\\\n\\\\nIn order to be compliant, your policy must be up-to-date, understandable, unambiguous, and easily accessible. Also, it has to:\\\\n\\\\n- describe the personal data collected and the purposes of their collection; - accurately list all the third parties the data is shared with; and - inform users of their rights in relation to their data.\\\\n\\\\nSee this privacy policy created with [our generator](https://www.iubenda.com/en/privacy-and-cookie-policy-generator) for an example of how these elements come together.

In addition to the information provided to data subjects by Meta Ireland via the Information about Page Insights, you should identify your own legal basis including the legitimate interests you pursue\\\\n\\\\nYou can create your own custom clause to disclose your use of Page Insights.

You can rely on any of the[6 legal bases provided under the GDPR.](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/5428-gdpr-guide#1-legal-basis-for-processing-data)\\\\n\\\\n## Meta’s responsibilities\\\\n\\\\nAs stated in the [Page Insights Controller Addendum](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum), Meta is taking on major responsibilities:\\\\n\\\\n> Unless specified otherwise in this Page Insights Addendum, between you and Meta Ireland, Meta Ireland assumes the responsibility for compliance with the applicable obligations under the GDPR for the processing of Insights data (including, but not limited to, Articles 12 and 13 GDPR, Articles 15 to 21 GDPR, Articles 33 and 34 GDPR). Meta Ireland will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the processing in accordance with Article 32 GDPR.\\\\n\\\\n### Joint controllership\\\\n\\\\nThe processing of personal data for Page Insights might be subject to the joint controllership arrangement: basically, if you’re a Facebook Page admin, both you and Meta are responsible for complying with the [GDPR](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/5428) in relation to Meta’s Page Insights service.\\\\n\\\\nIn any case, there is **no need to add a joint controller statement**, since Meta takes care of this aspect:\\\\n\\\\n> Meta Ireland will make the essence of this Page Insights Addendum available to data subjects (Article 26(2) GDPR). This is currently done via the Information about Page Insights data which can be accessed from all Pages.\\\\n\\\\n### Facebook Page Insights Controller Addendum Requests\\\\n\\\\nIf you need assistance with regard to a request in accordance with the Page Insights Controller Addendum, you can [submit this form](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/308592359910928):\\\\n\\\\nIn fact, on the Page Insights Controller Addendum Meta says:\\\\n\\\\n> If data subjects exercise their rights under the GDPR with regard to the processing of Insights data against you (Article 26(3) GDPR), or you are contacted by a supervisory authority with regard to the processing of Insights data, each a “request”, you will forward all relevant information regarding such requests to us promptly but within a maximum of seven calendar days. For this purpose, you can submit this form. Meta Ireland agrees to answer requests from data subjects in accordance with our obligations under this Page Insights Addendum.

This is especially true if you use tools that connect your websites, apps, and marketing activities to Facebook.\\\\n\\\\n- What data Facebook collects\\\\n\\\\n- How Meta uses it\\\\n\\\\n- What steps you need to take to meet your legal obligations and be transparent with your customers\\\\n\\\\nIf your business decides how and why personal data is collected or used, then under many global privacy laws you are accountable starting from the moment you collect it, and even after it’s shared with third parties like Meta.\\\\n\\\\nUnderstanding what data Facebook collects and how Meta uses that data matters for several other reasons, detailed below.\\\\n\\\\n### Regulatory compliance\\\\n\\\\nMeta must use the data you share in a way that meets regulatory requirements. Data privacy laws generally protect data belonging to individuals located in the law’s region of jurisdiction — like many countries under the European Union, a single country like Canada, or a US state.\\\\n\\\\nYou may be required to comply with several laws, depending on where your audience or customers are located, and what industry your business is in. Some of the most common global privacy laws are:\\\\n\\\\n- The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\\\\n\\\\n- Multiple US state-level data privacy laws, including, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)\\\\n\\\\n- Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (LGPD)\\\\n\\\\n- South Africa’s Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA)\\\\n\\\\n- Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)\\\\n\\\\n### Customer expectations\\\\n\\\\nAccording to data from Salesforce, 71 percent of customers are increasingly protective of their personal information. That growing caution makes it more important than ever for businesses to be clear about who has access to users’ personal data and how it’s used.\\\\n\\\\nIf your practices aren’t transparent — or if users feel misled — it can erode trust and harm your reputation.\\\\n\\\\n### Business impact\\\\n\\\\nFacebook’s data policies influence how effective your ads and analytics will be. Understanding what data Facebook uses and how it processes that data helps you make better decisions about targeting, measurement, and spend.\\\\n\\\\n### Evolving regulations\\\\n\\\\nNewer laws like the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) restrict how Meta can combine and use EU users’ data collected from one product — like Facebook — across its ecosystem. Meta has multiple platforms and billions of users, so this is a notable restriction on the data and revenue potential in their operations.\\\\n\\\\nThese changes affect how your business can use Meta tools for audience insights, cross-platform tracking, and personalized advertising in the EU. That means ongoing awareness is necessary for continued compliance.\\\\n\\\\n## Understanding Facebook’s data privacy policies and practices\\\\n\\\\nFacebook processes large volumes of personal data that’s collected from both users and businesses that use Meta Business Tools on their websites and apps.\\\\n\\\\nIn some regions, Facebook may also use data collected from other Meta platforms — such as Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp — depending on local privacy laws and user consent.\\\\n\\\\nHere’s a look at what data Facebook collects and how it’s used.\\\\n\\\\n### What data does Facebook collect?\\\\n\\\\n- User-provided information: Includes details that users enter when creating an account or making a purchase, such as their email address, phone number, age, profile photo, and payment or delivery information if they use Meta Pay or checkout features.\\\\n\\\\n- User activity: Facebook tracks what users click, post, like, and share, as well as who they message and otherwise interact with. Engagement with both ads and organic content is tracked.\\\\n\\\\n- App, browser, and device information: Facebook collectsdata from users’ phones, computers, or tablets, including: Device type Operating system Battery level Signal strength IP address App version Network GPS location Photos and camera access\\\\n\\\\n- Device type\\\\n\\\\n- Operating system\\\\n\\\\n- Battery level\\\\n\\\\n- Signal strength\\\\n\\\\n- IP address\\\\n\\\\n- App version\\\\n\\\\n- Network\\\\n\\\\n- GPS location\\\\n\\\\n- Photos and camera access\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to this user data, Facebook receives personal data from the businesses that use its tools.\\\\n\\\\nIf your business integrates Meta Business Tools — such as the Facebook Pixel, SDK, or Conversions API — that means you’re actively sending data about your website or app visitors to Meta. This may include pages viewed, purchases completed, or in-app events triggered by users.\\\\n\\\\n### How do Facebook and Meta use this information?\\\\n\\\\n#### Personalization (including ads)\\\\n\\\\n#### Product improvement\\\\n\\\\nMeta applies user activity information to enhance existing products and develop new features. It also uses device information, such as what’s happening in the background when a Meta app crashes.\\\\n\\\\n#### Safety and security\\\\n\\\\nMeta uses this information to detect and prevent suspicious activity, harmful behavior, spam, and fraud, aiming to keep the platform safe for users and businesses.\\\\n\\\\n#### Measurement and analytics\\\\n\\\\nMeta provides businesses with analytics and reports on ad performance and user engagement. It often uses data shared by businesses through Business Tools.\\\\n\\\\n### Role of cookies and tracking technologies\\\\n\\\\nMeta uses cookies, pixels, and other tracking technologies to collect personal data for a range of uses, including analytics and ad targeting.\\\\n\\\\nFacebook uses these tools to gather information from people who have Facebook accounts, use other Meta products and platforms, or visit third-party websites and apps that integrate Meta Products, such as the “like” or “share” buttons.\\\\n\\\\nImportantly, these tracking technologies can collect data from a person even if they aren’t logged into a Facebook account or don’t have a Facebook account at all (except for users in the European Region).\\\\n\\\\nWhen your business adds Meta Business Tools to your website, app, or online store, Meta can set and read cookies. Meta can then collect information about any visitor, not just Facebook users.\\\\n\\\\nThat means Meta builds advertising and analytics profiles using data from both its users and individuals who don’t use its platforms.\\\\n\\\\nMeta maintains a separate cookies policy that outlines its use of these tracking technologies. If your business receives traffic from visitors in regions with explicit consent requirements — which is an ever-increasing percentage of the world — it’s particularly important to review Meta’s cookies policy carefully.\\\\n\\\\nYou’ll need to implement consent mechanisms that meet legal standards and update your own privacy notices to reflect Meta’s tracking activities on your site.\\\\n\\\\nUnsure about what type of consent you need? Learn the differences between opt-in and opt-out consent and which type you need under different global privacy laws.\\\\n\\\\n### Who does Meta share personal data with?\\\\n\\\\nMeta shares personal data with some third parties for a variety of purposes.\\\\n\\\\nWhile the company states it doesn’t sell personal information, this kind of sharing can legally qualify as a “sale” of personal information under laws like the CCPA/CPRA, even when no money is exchanged.\\\\n\\\\nThe third parties Meta shares data with include the following:\\\\n\\\\n- Advertisers: Businesses that advertise on Meta’s platforms\\\\n\\\\n- Commerce and service partners: Businesses that offer goods or services on Facebook or other Meta products and platforms, as well as any providers acting on their behalf (for example, a payment processor)\\\\n\\\\n- Vendors and service providers: Third-party services that Meta uses to promote its own products, conduct research and surveys, deliver customer service, facilitate payments, analyze product usage, and investigate suspicious activity, among other things\\\\n\\\\n- Academic and public interest researchers: External researchers who focus on topics like safety, technology, or social impact\\\\n\\\\nBoth the data shared and who it’s shared with may vary based on how your business uses Meta Business Tools and what privacy choices users make.\\\\n\\\\n### International data transfers\\\\n\\\\nMeta transfers personal data across borders as part of its global operations. This includes sending data to countries where:\\\\n\\\\n- It has infrastructure, such as the United States, Ireland, Denmark, and Sweden, among others\\\\n\\\\n- Meta products are available\\\\n\\\\n- Its partners, vendors, service providers, and other third parties are located\\\\n\\\\nTo carry out these international data transfers in compliance with applicable privacy laws, Meta relies on legal mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and adequacy decisions.\\\\n\\\\nFor data transfers from the EU to the US, Meta states that, as of September 7, 2023, it relies on the EU-US Data Privacy Framework.\\\\n\\\\n### Sensitive information restrictions\\\\n\\\\nMeta prohibits businesses and partners from sharing certain types of sensitive information through its platform and tools.\\\\n\\\\nThis information includes, but is not limited to:\\\\n\\\\n- Health or medical data\\\\n\\\\n- Detailed financial data\\\\n\\\\n- Government ID numbers\\\\n\\\\n- GPS location data\\\\n\\\\n- Social Security numbers or local equivalents\\\\n\\\\n- Passwords\\\\n\\\\n- Any information that the sharer knows — or reasonably should know — is from or about a child under the age of 13\\\\n\\\\nIf Meta determines that a business may be violating these terms, it reserves the right to take action against that business.\\\\n\\\\n## How to align your business with privacy laws and Facebook privacy requirements\\\\n\\\\nWhile understanding Meta’s data practices is important, you must also be aware of your business’s direct responsibilities when handling user data in connection with Facebook, Meta Business Tools, and Meta products.\\\\n\\\\nBelow are the primary obligations you need to follow.\\\\n\\\\n### Meet EU consent standards under the GDPR and the DMA\\\\n\\\\nIf your business operates in the EU or targets users there, the Digital Markets Act (DMA) also requires Meta to obtain explicit user consent before combining personal data collected on your website with account information from Facebook or other Meta platforms for analytics or targeting.\\\\n\\\\nTo stay compliant, your consent banner or consent management platform (CMP) must clearly inform users of this data use and enable them to opt in.\\\\n\\\\nMonitor Facebook’s updates in the EU to make sure your consent collection practices align with both Facebook’s expectations and DMA requirements.\\\\n\\\\n### Follow data minimization principles\\\\n\\\\nWhen collecting personal data, practice data minimization by gathering only what you need. This helps you to comply with the GDPR and avoid sharing data that may be prohibited or unnecessary for your stated purpose.\\\\n\\\\n### Understand US opt-out requirements\\\\n\\\\nUS states that have implemented data privacy laws to date use an opt-out consent model. In most cases, prior consent for data collection and processing is not required, including for profiling or advertising. It is only necessary to enable users to opt out.\\\\n\\\\nMeta provides a Limited Data Use (LDU) parameter to help businesses comply. When enabled, Meta will limit how it processes the user’s data in line with the applicable state law, if that user had opted out.\\\\n\\\\nThe CCPA/CPRA includes an additional obligation that provides California residents the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal data for profiling or targeted advertising. Businesses must honor this right by prominently displaying a “Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Information” button or link.\\\\n\\\\nMany businesses choose to add this to their cookie banner, website footer, or app menu. You must also immediately stop sharing users’ data with Meta or other third parties when they exercise their right to opt out.\\\\n\\\\n### Follow purpose limitation principles\\\\n\\\\n### Protect the data you handle\\\\n\\\\nYour business is responsible for protecting any personal data it collects, processes, or shares, even after it has been shared with Meta. Data privacy laws like the GDPR and the CCPA/CPRA require businesses to implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to safeguard personal information.\\\\n\\\\nThese security obligations apply across the full data lifecycle — from collection to sharing. Any data processing agreement (DPA) you enter into with Meta should require Meta to apply the same security standards you use as a data controller.\\\\n\\\\nIf your business receives personal data from Meta, you’re responsible for protecting it just as you would any data you collect directly from users.\\\\n\\\\n### Be transparent with your users\\\\n\\\\nBelow is a non-exhaustive checklist of information the policy must include regarding your relationship with Meta.\\\\n\\\\n- Explain that you use Meta Business Tools, such as Facebook Pixel or Conversions API.\\\\n\\\\n- State your reasons for collecting and sharing data with Meta. For example, it may be used for ad targeting, analytics, or campaign measurement.\\\\n\\\\n- Disclose your use of Meta-related cookies and how users can manage or reject them through your site.\\\\n\\\\n- Inform users that data shared with Meta may be further shared by Meta, including with its partners or vendors.\\\\n\\\\n- Include links to Meta’s privacy and cookies policies.\\\\n\\\\n- Explain users’ rights under relevant laws and how they can exercise them, such as the right to object (under the GDPR) and the right to opt out (under the CCPA/CPRA).\\\\n\\\\n- If you use Meta ads for behavioral targeting, provide California users the option to opt out through a “Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Information” link.\\\\n\\\\n- If you rely on Facebook Page Insights, EU regulators treat you and Meta as joint data controllers. You should include a link to Facebook’s Page Controller Addendum and document this arrangement in your records of processing activities.\\\\n\\\\nMeta also requires that when you collect information from people who interact with your page, group, or event, you must first provide them with clear notice. Users must explicitly consent to your use of their data, and you must clearly explain that you, not Meta, are collecting and processing this information.\\\\n\\\\n### Take additional precautions when handling minors’ data\\\\n\\\\nMeta limits ad targeting for users under 18 to age and location only. Your business cannot circumvent these restrictions. For example, you must not use custom audiences based on lists known to include minors.\\\\n\\\\nIf your website or app is likely to attract minors, or if you collect data that could reasonably belong to users under 18, your business may be subject to heightened legal obligations. These requirements vary based on where your users are located and the nature of the data collected.\\\\n\\\\nThey include:\\\\n\\\\n- Obtaining verifiable parental consent under laws like the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the US, which must be separately obtained for collecting data and for sharing data\\\\n\\\\n- Obtaining explicit consent from a parent or legal guardian for minors under the age of 16, per GDPR requirements. EU member states can lower this to age 13\\\\n\\\\n- Using age verification mechanisms when age plays a role in data collection or eligibility for your services\\\\n\\\\nYour business must be prepared to meet these requirements if your data collection practices could involve users under the age of 18.\\\\n\\\\nUsercentrics does not provide legal advice, and information is provided for educational purposes only.

We'll discuss this in more detail below.\\\\n\\\\n### Personal Information You Collect\\\\n\\\\nWhether you're running a physical store, an ecommerce store, or online services business, you'll need to collect basic personal information such as customers' names and contact details.\\\\n\\\\nHere's an example from Bando:\\\\n\\\\nIf you have a broader online presence extending beyond your Facebook Page, you'll also need to explain the other ways in which you collect personal information.\\\\n\\\\nHere's an example from Microsoft:\\\\n\\\\n### How You Use Personal Information\\\\n\\\\nYou must explain your purposes for collecting personal information, i.e. how you use it.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, you can use your Facebook Page to enable customers to book appointments or make orders. Or you might use Facebook Messenger to engage with customers and receive inquiries.\\\\n\\\\nYou should have a clear business purpose for using any personal information you collect. If you collect email addresses, names, and shipping addresses, you must explain why you do this.\\\\n\\\\nHere's an example from catering business Chrissie Cakes and Supplies:\\\\n\\\\n### How You Share Personal Information\\\\n\\\\nHere's an example from ecommerce business Jasmin Studio Crafts:\\\\n\\\\nNote that you don't necessarily need to name the businesses with whom you share personal information: you can just identify the types of businesses.\\\\n\\\\n## If You Have Customers In the UK or EU\\\\n\\\\nIf you've ever visited a company's Facebook Page from within the UK or the EU (or the wider European Economic Area), you might have noticed a link reading \\\\\\\"Information about Page Insights data.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nClicking this link leads to a page explaining that Facebook and Facebook Page Admins are \\\\\\\"joint controllers\\\\\\\" under the GDPR.\\\\n\\\\nA German court required Facebook to create this policy based on how its \\\\\\\"Insights\\\\\\\" product works. Here's where to find Insights:\\\\n\\\\nThe Insights tool automatically collects data about who visits your Page. As a Page Admin, you would never be able to actually use this data to determine whether a particular individual had visited your page.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, according to the EU, this data is personal information. And under the GDPR, you and Facebook are jointly responsible for processing it.\\\\n\\\\n### Your Obligations Under Facebook's Page Insights Controller Addendum\\\\n\\\\nAs a Facebook Page Admin, you're held jointly responsible for Insights data. Facebook's Page Insights Controller Addendum sets the rules about how you and Facebook should meet your legal obligations.\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR allows joint controllers to decide among themselves how they will fulfill their legal obligations. Fortunately, Facebook has allocated almost all of the GDPR's duties to itself, and there's not much left for Page Admins to do.\\\\n\\\\nHere are Page Admins' duties under the Addendum:\\\\n\\\\n- Your legal basis for processing Page Insights data and the \\\\\\\"legitimate interests\\\\\\\" you are pursuing by using this data\\\\n\\\\n- The identity of your responsible data controller and their contact details\\\\n\\\\n- The identity of your Data Protection Officer (if you have one)\\\\n\\\\nFacebook doesn't explain what any of this means or how you can communicate it to your customers. That's where we come in.\\\\n\\\\n### Your Legal Basis and Legitimate Interests\\\\n\\\\nFacebook requires you to identify your legal basis for processing Page Insights data.\\\\n\\\\nThe concept of the \\\\\\\"legal basis\\\\\\\" (or \\\\\\\"lawful basis\\\\\\\") is very important under the GDPR.\\\\n\\\\nWe won't go into detail about the legal bases here. Essentially, there are six legal bases, and every time you collect personal information, you need to identify a legal basis for doing so.\\\\n\\\\nSo, what's your legal basis for receiving personal information from Page Insights? Well, Facebook suggests that it might be in your \\\\\\\"legitimate interests,\\\\\\\" which is one of the six legal bases.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\"Legitimate interests\\\\\\\" can be a suitable legal basis when you process personal information in a way that benefits your business without causing any significant privacy risks. You should carry out a Legitimate Interests Assessment if you plan on relying on this legal basis.\\\\n\\\\nHere's an example of a clause that addresses this:\\\\n\\\\nThe clause explains how Insights works and then identifies its legitimate interests in receiving Insights data: the ability to recognize user preferences and locations and to adapt and improve its offer accordingly.\\\\n\\\\n### Responsible Data Controller and Data Protection Officer\\\\n\\\\nFacebook requires that you provide a name and contact details for the \\\\\\\"responsible data controller.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe responsible data controller is your company. Your company is a data controller under the GDPR because it decides why and how to process personal information.\\\\n\\\\nFacebook also requires that you provide contact details for your Data Protection Officer. However, unless your business has over 250 employees, or it regularly processes sensitive personal information, it's unlikely you'll need to appoint a Data Protection Officer.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, go to your Facebook Page dashboard and select \\\\\\\"Edit Page Info\\\\\\\" in the top right-hand corner.\\\\n\\\\n## Summary\\\\n\\\\n- Who you are, and how your customers can contact you\\\\n\\\\n- What personal information you collect\\\\n\\\\n- How you use personal information\\\\n\\\\n- How you share personal information\\\\n\\\\nIf you have customers in the UK or EU, you also need to comply with Facebook's Page Insights Joint Controller Addendum.\\\\n\\\\nStay compliant with our agreements, policies, and consent banners — everything you need, all in one place.\\\\n\\\\nDisclaimer\\\\n\\\\nThis article is not a substitute for professional legal advice.

writer) and last updated on 01 July 2022.\\\\n\\\\nIf you operate a Facebook Page, both you and Facebook may need to follow the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Facebook has specific rules on how it splits GDPR responsibilities with Page administrators.\\\\n\\\\n- 1. GDPR Basics\\\\n\\\\n- 2. GDPR Controllers and Processors\\\\n\\\\n- 3. Facebook Page Insights and Personal Data\\\\n\\\\n- 4. Page Insights Controller Addendum\\\\n\\\\n- 5.1. Facebook Requirements\\\\n\\\\n- 5.1.1. Legal Basis\\\\n\\\\n- 5.1.2. Joint Controller Statement\\\\n\\\\n- 5.2. GDPR Requirements\\\\n\\\\n- 8. Summary\\\\n\\\\n## GDPR Basics\\\\n\\\\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Union regulation, meaning it has legal effect in every country that's a member of the EU.\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR applies to any personal data processing if:\\\\n\\\\n- The business that processes the data (or decides how it's processed) is in an EU country\\\\n\\\\n- The data subject (the person the data is about) is in an EU country, or\\\\n\\\\n- The data processing physically takes place in an EU country\\\\n\\\\n(Note that although the United Kingdom is no longer an EU country, it is currently scheduled to follow EU Regulations until the end of 2020. After that the same measures will still apply in the UK through domestic law until this law is revoked, amended or replaced.)\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR sets out a wide range of rules about personal data processing. The fundamentals are that:\\\\n\\\\n- It's only legal to process personal data in a limited range of circumstances, most commonly that the data subject has given meaningful consent or the processing is necessary for your legitimate interests.\\\\n\\\\n- Processing means any use of data, including collection and disclosure.\\\\n\\\\n- You must tell the data subject, in advance, the purpose or purposes for which you will process data.\\\\n\\\\n- You must inform the data subject again (and get fresh consent if appropriate) before processing the data for a new purpose.\\\\n\\\\n- The data subject has the right to know what data you store about them and whether you've disclosed it to a third party. They also have the right to correct errors and, in some circumstances, ask you to delete data.\\\\n\\\\n- You must adequately secure the data.\\\\n\\\\n## GDPR Controllers and Processors\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR holds two groups responsible for data processing.\\\\n\\\\n- Controllers decide what data is collected and how it is processed. They may also carry out the processing.\\\\n\\\\n- Processors carry out processing following the instructions of controllers.\\\\n\\\\nIn simple terms, both controllers and processors are responsible for complying with the GDPR, while controllers are also responsible for making sure processors working for them are complying with the GDPR.\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR also allows for the situation where two different controllers make decisions about processing the same data. As long as the same data is processed for the same purpose, the two are considered joint controllers.\\\\n\\\\nThis has important legal consequences. Ultimately both joint controllers are individually responsible for all the processing and could be individually responsible for paying compensation after a breach. However, the GDPR does allow the joint controllers to set out who will be in charge of complying with which specific GDPR requirements. This includes who will take responsibility for dealing with any complaints or any communication with regulators (known under the GDPR as supervisory authorities).\\\\n\\\\n## Facebook Page Insights and Personal Data\\\\n\\\\nFor the most part the data processing and GDPR situation with Facebook is simple. When individuals post on their own account or in groups, it is Facebook that is collecting and processing data and thus Facebook that is classed as the controller whenever that processing comes under the GDPR.\\\\n\\\\nThe situation is more complicated with Pages. These work in a similar way to a personal profile but cover an organization, business or brand. Rather than users becoming \\\\\\\"friends,\\\\\\\" users choose to \\\\\\\"like\\\\\\\" a page and can then see updates from it. Each Page is set up by a Facebook user who then acts as its administrator.\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR element comes into play because the administrator is able to access information about people who interact with the page. This information comes through a service called Page Insights which uses cookies to collect data about page interactions and users.\\\\n\\\\nThat created a legal argument that the Page administrator could be classed as a data controller because their decision to create the Page contributed to data being collected and processed.\\\\n\\\\nAs Facebook is also clearly a data controller in this context, it's down to Facebook and the Page administrator to determine whether they have joint controller status and how this will operate.\\\\n\\\\n## Page Insights Controller Addendum\\\\n\\\\nThe joint controller set-up is covered by the Page Insights Controller Addendum, which is part of Facebook's Pages, Groups and Events Policies. By creating a Page, you agree to this addendum and its position on joint controllers. In this context, \\\\\\\"Facebook\\\\\\\" means Facebook Ireland Limited.\\\\n\\\\nThe key points are as follows:\\\\n\\\\n- Facebook and the Page administrator are joint controllers in the case of data collected through Page events (that is, interactions with the Page) and then aggregated to provide it to the administrator through Page Insights.\\\\n\\\\n- The Page administrator is responsible for having a legal basis to process Insights Data.\\\\n\\\\n- Facebook is responsible for most other aspects of GDPR compliance, specifically: Facebook's own legal basis for processing data Informing data subjects about the collection and processing Handling the data subject's rights such as access, correction and deletion Making any notifications after a data breach\\\\n\\\\n- Facebook's own legal basis for processing data\\\\n\\\\n- Informing data subjects about the collection and processing\\\\n\\\\n- Handling the data subject's rights such as access, correction and deletion\\\\n\\\\n- Making any notifications after a data breach\\\\n\\\\nFacebook decides how to comply with its GDPR obligations.\\\\n\\\\nIf a Page Administrator receives a data access request regarding Page Insights data, they must not respond. Instead they must pass the request on to Facebook within seven days using this form:\\\\n\\\\n### Facebook Requirements\\\\n\\\\n#### Legal Basis\\\\n\\\\nFacebook requires you to tell users what your legal basis is for the collection and processing of data through Page Insights. (Remember that you are jointly responsible for such processing.)\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR sets out six allowable legal bases in Article 6:\\\\n\\\\n- Consent\\\\n\\\\n- Processing necessary to perform a contract\\\\n\\\\n- Processing necessary to comply with a legal obligation\\\\n\\\\n- Processing necessary to protect someone's vital interests\\\\n\\\\n- Processing necessary to carry out a task in the public interest or to exercise official authority\\\\n\\\\n- Processing necessary for the controller's legitimate interests\\\\n\\\\nPage visitors don't get enough information or give specific meaningful consent to make basis 1 suitable in most cases involving Page Insights. Bases 2 through 5 will rarely if ever apply to Page Insights.\\\\n\\\\nThis leaves basis 6, legitimate interests. For this basis to apply, you must go through a three point checklist:\\\\n\\\\n- What exactly is the legitimate interest?\\\\n\\\\n- Is the processing necessary to achieve this interest?\\\\n\\\\n- Do the individual's personal data rights and freedoms override this interest?\\\\n\\\\nNormally your access to Page Insights should meet these tests and thus legitimate interests is an acceptable legal basis.\\\\n\\\\nUsing Page Insights helps you learn more about your audience and thus improve and target the service and information you provide. The fact you can only access the information in aggregated form means it doesn't pose a serious risk or breach of privacy for an individual.\\\\n\\\\nRomantic Germany goes beyond simply stating it relies on \\\\\\\"legitimate interests\\\\\\\" and instead explains to users what this means:\\\\n\\\\n#### Joint Controller Statement\\\\n\\\\nLufthansa does this in a policy dedicated to its Facebook Page:\\\\n\\\\nBASF gives additional detail on what data is processed through Page Insights, listing specifics like your country of location, number of visits, gender relations, etc.:\\\\n\\\\n### GDPR Requirements\\\\n\\\\n- Your identity and contact details that of your data protection officer (if you have one)\\\\n\\\\n- What data you process\\\\n\\\\n- The purpose for processing\\\\n\\\\n- The legal basis for processing\\\\n\\\\n- How long you'll keep the data\\\\n\\\\n- Whether you share the data with anyone else\\\\n\\\\n- The user's rights to access data, correct it, and ask you to delete it\\\\n\\\\nGood Game Studios puts this information directly after the details of the Page Insights data processing:\\\\n\\\\n- Answer a few questions about your business:\\\\n\\\\n- Enter the country and click on the \\\\\\\"Next Step\\\\\\\" button:\\\\n\\\\nThe second is to make sure your identity and contact details are clearly listed in the About section of your Page. To avoid confusion, do so through the standard About field rather than posting it elsewhere on the Page, for example as a pinned post:\\\\n\\\\n## Summary\\\\n\\\\nLet's recap what you need to know and do to comply with the joint controller rules for Facebook Page Insights:\\\\n\\\\n- The GDPR applies if a data controller, a data subject, or the processing itself is in an EU country.\\\\n\\\\n- When the GDPR applies, the data controller must give the data subject details of what data is processed, how and why. They must have a legal basis to process the data.\\\\n\\\\n- A data controller is the person or organization that decides what data to process and how to do so. The GDPR allows for joint controllers of particular data. They share legal responsibility but can divide compliance tasks between them.\\\\n\\\\n- Facebook collects data about interactions with Pages and makes this data available to Page administrators through the Page Insight program.\\\\n\\\\n- Facebook's terms - which Page administrators must agree to - say that Facebook and the Page administrator are joint controllers for the Page Insight data.\\\\n\\\\n- Facebook agrees to handle most of the GDPR compliance tasks relating to the Page Insight data. It requires the Page administrator to take responsibility for having a legal basis for the data's processing. In most cases this will be \\\\\\\"legitimate interests.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n- Page users can make data access requests to the Page administrator, but the Page administrator must pass this on to Facebook within seven days. Facebook will handle the request.\\\\n\\\\n- Add their full contact details\\\\n\\\\n### About this article\\\\n\\\\nLast updated\\\\n\\\\nThis article was last updated on 01 July 2022.\\\\n\\\\nAuthor\\\\n\\\\nJohn Lister\\\\n\\\\nFreePrivacyPolicy Legal writer\\\\n\\\\nCategory\\\\n\\\\nDisclaimer\\\\n\\\\nPlease note that legal information, including legal templates and legal policies, is not legal advice.\\\\n\\\\n### Try out our free generators\\\\n\\\\nFree Cookie Consent\\\\n\\\\nFree Terms and Conditions Generator\\\\n\\\\nFree Cookies Policy Generator\\\\n\\\\nFree Disclaimer Generator\\\\n\\\\nFree EULA Generator\\\\n\\\\nFree Return & Refund Policy Generator\\\\n\\\\n### What our customers says\\\\n\\\\n— Anonymous\\\\n\\\\n— Andrea - Toronto Success Coach\\\\n\\\\nQuick and easy way to secure our company website.

There's lots of information in our Data Policy about the kinds of information we collect, with some examples and links to where you can learn more. But here are some of the categories of things we receive: the content you provide when you post, like or comment, your connections, your transactions, and your usage of our products. We also collect information that other people provide about you, like when they tag you in a photo. We also collect information from your device, such as identifiers, cookies, and information you can control using your device settings, including your camera, microphone and different kinds of location information, along with information from our partners, like websites you visit, apps you use or purchases you make.\\\\n\\\\nSharing Your Data\\\\n\\\\nData allows us to provide a personalized experience to different people, and to learn new things and improve our service. There's lots of information in our Data Policy about the ways we use the information we have, with some examples and links to where you can learn more. But here are some of the ways we use data:\\\\n\\\\n- People and accounts on Instagram, depending on the audience you choose, your settings, and the features you use. Remember that public information can be seen by anyone.\\\\n\\\\n- Services (like apps and websites) you choose to give access to your Instagram information, like if you use a service to see all your social media together. You can revoke their access to your information, here.\\\\n\\\\n- Advertisers. We help advertisers understand whether their ads are effective. We also share with companies that help to make reports for advertisers.\\\\n\\\\n- Companies that offer things through Instagram, like if you buy something and provide your shipping address.\\\\n\\\\n- Vendors and service providers we hire to help us with our business.\\\\n\\\\n- Researchers and academics, like to try to understand how to stop bullying and harassment online.\\\\n\\\\n- Legal requests (like from a court or law enforcement), when consistent with the law and our policies.\\\\n\\\\nHow To Access and Download Your Data\\\\n\\\\nA great first step to controlling your online data is to understand what you’ve shared. We offer tools to review the information we have for your account and the data you’ve shared on Instagram. You’ll see information we have about you, as well as your content, like your posts, comments, and messages. Learn how to use these tools in our Help Center.\\\\n\\\\nHow to Delete Your Data\\\\n\\\\nSometimes people change their minds about things they’ve shared online. To delete a photo or video that you've posted, tap above your post and then tap Delete. You can also archive posts to hide them from your profile and make it so your followers and other people on Instagram can't see it. But don’t worry—when you archive a post, it keeps all its likes and comments.\\\\n\\\\nYou can also temporarily disable or delete your account at any time. When you delete your account, we delete your posts, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Learn more.\\\\n\\\\nAnything that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted if you delete your account. But, if you are concerned about a picture or information someone else has posted about you, you can report it to us.

It stipulates that all tech providers will use data solely for the specific purpose outlined by the client.\\\\n\\\\nTech providers are also subject to rules regarding client information, data sharing with clients, and client termination.\\\\n\\\\n### Prohibited Practices Regarding Data Use\\\\n\\\\nSome of the prohibited uses include:\\\\n\\\\n- Processing platform data to discriminate or encourage discrimination against others\\\\n\\\\n- Processing platform data to make eligibility determinations about people (like housing, employment, or education opportunities)\\\\n\\\\n- Processing platform data to perform or facilitate surveillance\\\\n\\\\n- Selling, licensing, or purchasing the data\\\\n\\\\n- Placing the data on a search engine or making it otherwise available\\\\n\\\\n- Decoding, circumventing, re-identifying, de-anonymising, or unscrambling the data in any way\\\\n\\\\n- Changing the functionality of your app or data processing so users view it as an unfamiliar or different app\\\\n\\\\n- Processing friends list from Facebook (also owned by Meta) to establish social connections in your platform, unless each person grants you access for that purpose\\\\n\\\\nTheir policy outlines additional restrictions regarding who you share the data with and your data retention, deletion, and accessibility options for consumers granted those rights by data privacy laws and regulations.\\\\n\\\\nThese laws impact businesses worldwide, and some have very broad thresholds, so chances are at least one applies to your business.\\\\n\\\\nWhile each piece of legislation is different, you’ll need to include the following information:\\\\n\\\\n- What personal data you collect\\\\n\\\\n- Why you collect the information\\\\n\\\\n- How you use it (aka, your legal basis)\\\\n\\\\n- Who you share it with or sell it to\\\\n\\\\n- What rights your users have over that data\\\\n\\\\n- How they can follow through on those rights\\\\n\\\\n- California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which amends some areas of the CCPA\\\\n\\\\n- California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)\\\\n\\\\n- Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA)\\\\n\\\\n- Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)\\\\n\\\\n#### Introduction\\\\n\\\\nIn this section, you introduce your business, explain who the terms of the policy apply to, and write clear definitions of phrases used throughout the agreement so your users’ expectations are properly set.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, this is where you would want to include your business’s physical address and even its complete legal entity name(s).\\\\n\\\\nSee an image of their introductory clause below.\\\\n\\\\n#### What Personal Data You Collect\\\\n\\\\nIn this section, list the categories of personal data you collect and process about your users, including any sensitive personal information.\\\\n\\\\nBe thorough and specific in this section to meet the Instagram Platform Terms and any additional legal requirements.\\\\n\\\\nAdobe has an excellent example of this clause, shown in the screenshot below.\\\\n\\\\n#### Why You Collect the Data and How it Gets Used\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re subject to laws like the GDPR or the CCPA, you must say why you collect the data and include your legal basis.\\\\n\\\\n#### Who You Share the Data With\\\\n\\\\nThis way, your users can read those third-party agreements and decide if they’re comfortable giving those entities access to their information.\\\\n\\\\nBelow, see how Adobe formats this clause in their privacy agreement.\\\\n\\\\n#### Internet Cookies\\\\n\\\\nUnder laws like the GDPR and CCPA, internet cookies qualify as personal data, plus most of these regulations give users the right to limit how their information gets used regarding analytics and advertising.\\\\n\\\\nAdobe includes a short paragraph with live links to their other policies, shown below.\\\\n\\\\n#### The Legal Rights of Your Consumers\\\\n\\\\nYou must list all rights your users have over their data if you’re subject to laws like the GDPR, CCPA, or the Virginia CDPA.\\\\n\\\\nYou can do this in one clause or separate it into policies specific to users in those unique areas.\\\\n\\\\n#### Information Regarding Children’s Data\\\\n\\\\nIf your services target children, you must follow additional requirements to process their information, like obtaining consent from their legal guardians.\\\\n\\\\n#### International Data Transfers\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR outlines specific guidelines regarding international data transfers.\\\\n\\\\nSome countries are approved for transfers because they follow the same safety standards mandated by the regulation.\\\\n\\\\nBut if you transfer to other places, including the US, you must ensure the third party signs an agreement stating they’ll abide by all the obligations, user rights, and data protocols required by the GDPR.\\\\n\\\\nBelow, read how Adobe phrases this clause in its policy.\\\\n\\\\n#### Safety and Security\\\\n\\\\nAdobe puts a short paragraph in its policy to meet this legal requirement, as shown below.\\\\n\\\\n- Use a managed solution\\\\n\\\\n- Try a free template\\\\n\\\\n- Do it yourself\\\\n\\\\nLet’s walk through these solutions so you can choose what’s best for you.\\\\n\\\\n### Managed Solution\\\\n\\\\nTo use it, you answer questions about your business, and it kicks out a compliant, properly formatted agreement that you can then link to your website or app.\\\\n\\\\nTermly’s product engineers and data privacy experts help ensure that all of the tools reflect the most recent data privacy laws and regulations, which often change.\\\\n\\\\nSee a screenshot of our generator below.\\\\n\\\\n### Free Template\\\\n\\\\nThese take more work on your end, as you’ll have to fill out blank sections of the agreement manually. But they still provide proper formatting, the most common clauses, and standardized language that typically appears in these legal policies.\\\\n\\\\nI recommend using a template if you don’t actually collect data from your users or if your data processing is minimal.\\\\n\\\\nBelow, you can see a screenshot of our free template.\\\\n\\\\n### Do-It-Yourself\\\\n\\\\n- Make your policy clear and freely accessible.

Every photo. Every voice message. Fed into AI,\\\\\\\" the post read.\\\\n\\\\nThe claim was also spread on [Threads](https://www.threads.com/@hustlewithchip/post/DQscX-SAQJc) ([archived](https://archive.ph/PpDTq)) and prompted Snopes readers to search the site for the truth of it.\\\\n\\\\nMeta's planned privacy policy update on Dec. 16, 2025, does not pertain to direct messages and does not change how Meta handles them, though. The update instead will focus on how it uses data collected from conversations people have with Meta AI, the company's generative artificial intelligence (AI) app. We therefore rate this claim as false.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\"The update mentioned in the viral rumor isn't about DMs at all, it's about how we'll use people's interactions with our AI features to further personalize their experience,\\\\\\\" a Meta spokesperson told Snopes over email. \\\\\\\"We do not use the content of your private messages with friends and family to train our AIs unless you or someone in the chat chooses to share those messages with our AIs. This also isn't new, nor is it part of this Dec. 16 privacy policy update.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nOn Oct. 1, 2025, [Meta revealed](https://about.fb.com/news/2025/10/improving-your-recommendations-apps-ai-meta/) that it planned to update its privacy policy on Dec. 16. The incoming major change to the company's privacy policy, according to the news release, was that Meta would start using peoples' interactions with its generative AI features to personalize content and ad recommendations.\\\\n\\\\nFollowing the announcement, Meta kept both its [current privacy policy](https://archive.ph/nLWj7), last updated in June 2025, and its [upcoming privacy policy](https://archive.ph/BDgxu#1) on its website.\\\\n\\\\nIn both [current](https://archive.ph/nLWj7#selection-479.0-483.39:~:text=Messages%20you%20send%20and%20receive%2C%20including%20their%20content%2C%20subject%20to%20applicable%20law.%20On%20some%20Products%2C%20you%20can%20use%20end%2Dto%2Dend%20encrypted%20messages.%20Learn%20more%20about%20how%20end%2Dto%2Dend%20encryption%20works.) and [new](https://archive.ph/BDgxu#selection-475.0-479.39:~:text=Messages%20that%20you%20send%20and%20receive%2C%20including%20their%20content%2C%20subject%20to%20applicable%20law.%20On%20some%20Products%2C%20you%20can%20use%20end%2Dto%2Dend%20encrypted%20messages.%20Learn%20more%20about%20how%20end%2Dto%2Dend%20encryption%20works.) privacy policies, the section on that data Meta collects included the same passage about messages:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\"Messages that you send and receive, including their content, subject to applicable law. On some Products, you can use end-to-end encrypted messages.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAccording to [Meta's policies](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/1084673321594605), end-to-end encrypted messages cannot be read by Meta: \\\\\\\"End-to-end encrypted messages and calls ensure only you and the people you're communicating with can see or listen to what is sent, and no one else, not even Meta, can do so.\\\\\\\" Despite this policy, people can choose to [store encrypted messages remotely with Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/820525008940780) and Meta may read encrypted messages if one of the people in the conversation [reports a message](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/498828660322839?cms_platform=android-app&helpref=platform_switcher). When someone reports an encrypted message, recent messages from that conversation are forwarded and sent to Meta for review, according to the company's policies.\\\\n\\\\nAt the time Meta launched default encrypted messages on Messenger in December 2023, the company [wrote](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/12/default-end-to-end-encryption-on-messenger/#:~:text=nobody%2C%20including%20Meta%2C%20can%20see%20what%E2%80%99s%20sent%20or%20said%2C%20unless%20you%20choose%20to%20report%20a%20message), \\\\\\\"nobody, including Meta, can see what's sent or said, unless you choose to report a message.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nNot all messaging systems on Meta's platforms are encrypted. While Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp conversations are set to be encrypted by default, chats with Facebook groups, chats with businesses and Marketplace chats are [not encrypted](https://archive.ph/ulJzQ). According to Meta policy, the company may collect that data.\\\\n\\\\n#### Sources\\\\n\\\\nCrisan, Loredana. \\\\\\\"Launching Default End-To-End Encryption on Messenger.\\\\\\\" Meta, 7 Dec. 2023, about.fb.com/news/2023/12/default-end-to-end-encryption-on-messenger/.

Usually, they’re incredibly difficult to read. Research, [polling](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/), [reporting](https://themarkup.org/the-breakdown/2023/08/03/how-to-quickly-get-to-the-important-truth-inside-any-privacy-policy), and personal experiences [abound](https://iacis.org/iis/2022/2_iis_2022_138-149.pdf) on why privacy policies are so [bad](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/05/31/abolish-privacy-policies/) these days: [they are too long](https://lorrie.cranor.org/pubs/readingPolicyCost-authorDraft.pdf), [use legalistic and inaccessible terminology](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/12/opinion/facebook-google-privacy-policies.html), [are presented as take-it-or-leave-it](https://kb.osu.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/ff3341dc-dd6f-5fdf-920c-245521837c05/content), and [much more](https://kb.osu.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/d6692cd5-a08e-534e-9350-735fb279bce4/content). None of this is new information (although, it’s all still a serious and widespread problem).\\\\n\\\\nBut less attention is often paid to how privacy policies themselves are *displayed.*As someone who has spent a substantial amount of time reviewing these policies across countless companies and platforms, in my work researching commercial data practices, I’ve come to regard one company as perhaps the worst of the lot in how it visually presents its policies: Meta. Regulators and lawmakers should take note.\\\\n\\\\n## How did it get this way?\\\\n\\\\nThe 20-year-old, US-based multinational conglomerate founded by Mark Zuckerberg has [over three billion](https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2024/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2023-Results-Initiates-Quarterly-Dividend/default.aspx) daily active users worldwide and operates products and services ranging from Facebook and Instagram to WhatsApp, Oculus, and AI models such as Llama. Yet, understanding what the company is collecting, inferring, and purchasing, let alone doing with individuals’ data, is made even more challenging by the way Meta incomprehensibly lays out its privacy policy language.\\\\n\\\\nIt is, to say the least, a test to think of any company besides Meta that puts so much effort into breaking up its privacy policies into probably hundreds of indigestible pieces, scattered across numerous websites and pages, with confusing hyperlinks, circular references to documents, no ability to comprehensively and functionally search across documents, and misleading or inaccurate statements about what specific pages describe to the viewer. In other words: it’s a usability disaster.\\\\n\\\\nSearching “Meta privacy policy” online brings up a [page on Facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/) titled “What is the Privacy Policy and what does it cover?” It’s remarkably long. It’s broken up into many subsections. It’s difficult to search. It’s hard to navigate. And, at the time of this writing, that webpage alone had 168 links to various other webpages and pop-ups within the page.\\\\n\\\\nIf you click on just one of those, such as “[Review the privacy policies of the other Meta companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678),” it brings you to a page called “[The Meta Companies](https://web.archive.org/web/20241008070028/https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678)” which then links to terms for Meta Payments, Facebook Payments International, and more. When I clicked on the [EU privacy terms for Facebook Payments Limited International](https://web.archive.org/web/20240927014044/https://www.facebook.com/payments_terms/EU_privacy), it directed me to a page with no information on it that prompted me to log into a Facebook.com account. One page claims to tell you something useful and points to many other pages and popups, which also tell you you’ll get the information you want—if you just click one more hyperlink. It’s turtles all the way down.\\\\n\\\\nDesigning privacy information in this way makes it nearly impossible for the average user to understand what Meta does with respect to a specific product, service, or technology. Looking to learn what information is [collected and transmitted](https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/06/16/facebook-is-receiving-sensitive-medical-information-from-hospital-websites) via the Meta Pixel? If you’re hoping for a quick read, good luck. Meta breaks its Pixel documentation into numerous pages, and when you click on a link on the Pixel [Advanced Matching page](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel/advanced/advanced-matching) that claims to help you “learn what data is sent when using the Meta Pixel,” it directs you to the [general page](https://transparency.meta.com) for Meta’s Transparency Center. Now, we’re back where we started above, with numerous subsections and 168 links and pop-ups. Only by pulling together information from [many](https://web.archive.org/web/20241006044549/https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel/) [different](https://web.archive.org/web/20241003134755/https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel/implementation/conversion-tracking#custom-events) webpages is it possible for a user to even *see* all the information Meta posts about what data the Meta Pixel can transmit. (That’s before attempting to understand it.)\\\\n\\\\nTake another example. Maybe you’re concerned about Meta [saying](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/meta-will-start-collecting-anonymized-data-about-quest-headset-usage/) in February 2024 it would begin collecting what it called “anonymized” device usage data about Oculus headsets—at the same time as Meta [ended](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/4503393-meta-set-to-delete-all-oculus-account-data-by-end-of-march/) consumers’ ability to use an Oculus Quest headset without creating a Meta account or linking it to an existing one. Well, learning about that topic is a nightmare, too. The webpage for “[Legal Documents](https://web.archive.org/web/20240926134919/https://www.meta.com/legal/quest/)” about Quest devices links to dozens of different webpages, including a variety of “supplemental” policies and documents, that themselves have many links and subsections, again perpetuating the same design and layout problem. It would take hours just to pull together the information, before any work on consolidation and interpretation.\\\\n\\\\nMeta didn’t always display its privacy information this way. But over the years, the company (once eponymously known for its first product, Facebook) has presented its privacy policy in an [increasingly graphics-oriented format](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/13/facebook-updates-privacy-policy-data), riddled with drop-downs and buttons. The substance of that evolving set of privacy policies, as [pointed out](https://archive.epic.org/2014/12/facebook-revises-privacy-polic.html) by nonprofit groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center, has made clear the company has continued to collect and use individuals’ data without meaningful consent. Yet, the days when users could use a little CTRL+F or CMD+F magic to search for words within a page are in the rearview mirror. Meta’s design and display decisions have made answering basic questions—such as “what data does Meta gather via virtual reality headsets?” or “from which apps and services does Meta collect fine-grained geolocation data?”—virtually impossible for the average user. You can’t even attempt to understand what you can’t easily access in the first place. Given how much effort this confusing design must take, that might be Meta’s very objective.\\\\n\\\\n## It’s worse by comparison\\\\n\\\\nTo be very clear, Meta is hardly the only problematic actor when it comes to privacy policies. As described above, privacy policies are rife with length, complexity, and other issues. Many companies drown their privacy policies in words like “could,” “might,” or “may,” and while it might make for fun semantic debate in a law class, these hypotheticals don’t tell readers what companies are *actually doing* with data. They also intentionally leave the door open to companies doing anything they want with individuals’ data tomorrow or five years from now.\\\\n\\\\n#### Our Content delivered to your inbox.\\\\n\\\\nJoin our newsletter on issues and ideas at the intersection of tech & democracy\\\\n\\\\n#### Thank you!\\\\n\\\\nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list.\\\\n\\\\nThe privacy policy for Google, for example, is not the most accessible document in the world and [contains](https://iacis.org/iis/2022/2_iis_2022_138-149.pdf) many such hypothetical statements and privacy loopholes. It also has lots of vague language. But Meta stands out even from its data-hoarding competitors like Google and TikTok in just how badly it presents its “privacy policy” information—and just how difficult it is, should you have a specific question about a specific service or product, to find concrete information about what Meta does with your data.\\\\n\\\\n## Where are the regulators?\\\\n\\\\nAt a certain point, there should be consequences for designing the layout and presentation of privacy policies in completely unreasonably segmented, obfuscating ways. Perhaps it’s worth an inquiry into whether such practices violate the US [Federal Trade Commission Act](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/statutes/federal-trade-commission-act) and similar prohibitions on deceptive business practices. Legislators should prevent these bad practices in future privacy laws, too.\\\\n\\\\nThe FTC, for its part, has been clear in its [enforcement decisions](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/D%26O-InMarketMediaLLC.pdf) that companies should seek “affirmative express consent” from consumers before collecting and using their data. Doing so requires “clear and conspicuous disclosure” to consumers of the categories of data collected about them; the purposes of data collection, use, and disclosure; “a simple, descriptive URL (or hyperlink if technically possible) to a document that describes” this information; and “a simple, descriptive URL (or hyperlink if technically possible) to a simple, easily-located means by which the consumer can withdraw consent and that describes any limitations on the consumer’s ability to withdraw consent.” Otherwise, companies may be in violation of [Section 5 of the FTC Act](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/mission/enforcement-authority)—and its prohibition on unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\\\\n\\\\nMeta does not appear to clearly and conspicuously describe the data it collects about individuals. It does not have simple, descriptive URLs for these pages—in fact, any single privacy-related document on a Meta website could link to dozens or over 100 other pages and pop-ups that Meta purports provide additional information. Both of these points raise the question of whether Meta is deviating from practices the FTC has indicated are legally required.\\\\n\\\\nFurther, the FTC Act prevents deceptive practices in general—[defined](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/mission/enforcement-authority) by FTC [policy](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/410531/831014deceptionstmt.pdf) as “involving a material representation, omission, or practice that is likely to mislead a consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances.” If any number of pages on the Meta website that claim to provide consumers with information about privacy do not, in fact, provide and present said information in a reasonable manner (or, really, at all), it likewise raises the question of whether Meta might be violating the FTC Act by deceptively *designing* the layout of its privacy policy information.\\\\n\\\\nLawmakers working on privacy bills should not forget that substance *and* layout are important for privacy policies, to avoid these kinds of bad practices that bury information from consumers and regulators, further limit consumers’ ability to consent, and threaten individuals’ ability to exercise their privacy rights. New laws on privacy should require companies to make their privacy policies clearly laid out, on a single or just a few webpage(s), in an easily navigable and comprehensively searchable format. Regulators should also ask the question of whether certain kinds of presentations of privacy policies violate existing federal and state laws, introducing the need to investigate and potentially enforce compliance.\\\\n\\\\nWe’re long overdue for better laws, regulations, and technology practices for presenting data collection and use information to consumers. But in some cases, the design and presentation of privacy information is itself a serious problem—and Meta might just win the prize for “worst in show.”\\\\n\\\\n#### Related Reading\\\\n\\\\n- [Researchers Consider the Impact of Meta's CrowdTangle Shutdown](https://www.techpolicy.press/researchers-consider-the-impact-of-metas-crowdtangle-shutdown/) - [We Know a Little About Meta’s “Break Glass” Measures.

At Meta, we’ve always set out to build personalized experiences that provide value without compromising your privacy. So, it’s on us to have strong protections for the data we use and be transparent about how we use it. That includes communicating more clearly about our data practices and the choices you have.\\\\n\\\\nWe’re also including more ways to access controls you can use to experience our products in ways that are right for you. You can continue to manage your privacy settings at any time and we’re committed to letting you know if we make important changes to how we collect, use and share your information.\\\\n\\\\n## Responding To Feedback and Evolving Regulation\\\\n\\\\n## Privacy Center\\\\n\\\\nYou can think of Privacy Center as a hub for your privacy questions, where you can learn about how we use data, make use of some of the various privacy controls that we offer, and brush up on key account security tips and tools. We’ll also continue adding more guides and controls to it.\\\\n\\\\n## Updating Controls for Your Privacy\\\\n\\\\nNew Audience Controls: Starting today, we’re also rolling out a new setting to make it easier to manage who sees your posts on Facebook. Now, when someone selects a default audience, that audience selection will apply to new posts created in Facebook that they share to their timeline unless they select a different audience for a particular post. Previously, your default audience for posts matched whichever audience you chose most recently. So if you had just made a post that was available to the public, your subsequent posts would be as well. This new setting will help make sure you’re sharing with the right people in your community.\\\\n\\\\nNew Ways to Manage the Ads You See: Recently, we consolidated the Ad Topics and Interest Categories controls into a single control that can be accessed on Facebook and Instagram, covering a more extensive set of ad topics. This allows people to use a single control to set preferences across ad topics that reflect the interest targeting categories advertisers may use to reach them and the content they might see in an ad.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"We’ve added more detailed explanations in our Privacy Policy including about how we use and share information with third parties. And we’ve paired it with the Privacy Center and new controls to manage your experience, like who sees your posts and the topics you want to see ads about.

We enable you and third parties, like businesses, to communicate and interact with each other using our Services, such as Catalogs for businesses on WhatsApp through which you can browse products and services and place orders. Businesses may send you transaction, appointment, and shipping notifications; product and service updates; and marketing. For example, you may receive flight status information for upcoming travel, a receipt for something you purchased, or a notification when a delivery will be made. Messages you receive from a business could include an offer for something that might interest you.

When you or others use third-party services or other Meta Company Products that are integrated with our Services, those third-party services may receive information about what you or others share with them. For example, if you use a data backup service integrated with our Services (like iCloud or Google Account), they will receive information you share with them, such as your WhatsApp messages. If you interact with a third-party service or another Meta Company Product linked through our Services, such as when you use the in-app player to play content from a third-party platform, information about you, like your IP address and the fact that you are a WhatsApp user, may be provided to such third party or Meta Company Product.

You can choose to share your Status, which is also end-to-end encrypted.\\\\n\\\\n- You may also provide content that is not encrypted which means that we can see it. This includes your profile picture, your \\\\\\\"about\\\\\\\" information and names and descriptions of your communities and groups.\\\\n\\\\n- Your Connections. You can use contact upload and provide us with the phone numbers in your device address book on a regular basis, including those of users of our Services and your other contacts. If any of your contacts aren’t yet using our Services, we’ll manage this information in a way that is designed to ensure that those contacts cannot be identified by us. Learn more about contact upload and about the information we provide to people who do not use WhatsApp here. We also collect information on users who contact you that aren't in your device address book and any users you've blocked or who have blocked you.\\\\n\\\\n- Your Community and Group Information. You can create, join, or get added to communities, groups and broadcast lists, and such communities, groups and lists get associated with your account. You give your groups and communities a name. You can provide a community or group profile picture or description. We also collect information about when communities and groups are created or updated.\\\\n\\\\n- Customer Support Information And Other Communications. When you contact us for customer support or otherwise communicate with us (for example, through optional surveys), you may provide us with information related to your use of our Services, including copies of your messages, any other information you deem helpful in order for us to understand and resolve your query, and how to contact you (e.g., an email address). For example, you may send us an email with information relating to app performance or other issues. We also collect information on how you use our customer support features (e.g., the searches you make on our Help Center), any feedback you give us on the customer support experience and your responses to surveys or questions on a range of topics (including, for example, what you like or don't like about the Service or Meta Companies).\\\\n\\\\n### Automatically Collected Information\\\\n\\\\n- Usage Information.We collect information about your usage of our Services. This includes collecting information about your activity (including how you use our Services), how you interact with others using our Services (including when you search for and interact with a business), and the time, frequency, and duration of your activities. This also includes information about the features you use like our messaging (and integrated applications), calling, Status, communities, groups or business features; whether you are online; timestamps related to your use such as when you last used our Services (your \\\\\\\"last seen\\\\\\\") and the times you send and receive calls and messages; and when you last updated your \\\\\\\"about\\\\\\\" information.\\\\n\\\\n- Log and Troubleshooting Information. We collect information about how our Services are performing when you use them, like service related diagnostic and performance information. This information includes log files, timestamps, diagnostic or crash data, website performance logs and error messages or reports.\\\\n\\\\n- Device And Connection Information. We collect device and connection-specific information when you install, access, or use our Services. This includes information such as hardware model, operating system information, battery level, signal strength, app version, browser information, mobile network, connection information including whether you are using wifi or cellular data, mobile operator or internet service provider (ISP), language and time zone, IP address, device operations information and identifiers (including identifiers unique to Meta Company Products associated with the same device or account).\\\\n\\\\n- General Location Information. Even if you do not choose to use our precise location-related features (see Information Shared by You and by WhatsApp with Third Parties), we use IP addresses and other information like phone number area codes, to estimate your general location (e.g., country).\\\\n\\\\n- Cookies. We collect information using cookies to operate and provide our web-based Services and website. Learn more about how we use cookies to provide you our Services.\\\\n\\\\n- User Choices. We collect information about your in-app settings, privacy settings and records about when you accepted terms. Only you are in control of your privacy settings which can be used to change who can see your \\\\\\\"last seen\\\\\\\", profile photo, \\\\\\\"about\\\\\\\" information, Status updates, read receipts or add you to groups. We also collect information about whether you have enabled push notifications and whether you wish to send disappearing messages.\\\\n\\\\n- Authentication Information. To verify and grant appropriate authorisations as you use the Services (such as when you choose to use encrypted backups and create your unique password), we create and store authentication codes which are a security measure to ensure only you are accessing your account. Authentication Information also includes your public encryption keys that our end-to-end encryption protocol uses. Messages are encrypted before they reach our servers which means that we cannot see them.\\\\n\\\\n### Information Third Parties Provide About You\\\\n\\\\n- Information Others Provide About You. We receive information about you from other users. For example, when other users you know use our Services, they may provide your phone number if they use contact upload just as you may provide theirs. We require each of these users to have lawful rights to collect, use, and share your information before providing any information to us. They may also send you messages, send messages to groups to which you belong, or call you. You should keep in mind that in general any user can capture screenshots of your chats or messages or make recordings of your calls with them and send them to WhatsApp or anyone else, or post them on another platform.\\\\n\\\\n- User Reports. Just as you can report other users, other users or third parties may also choose to report to us your interactions and your messages with them or others on our Services; for example, to report possible violations of our Terms or policies. When a report is submitted to us through the reporting tools, we receive information from the reporter on both the reporting user and those reported. To find out more about the information we receive when a User Report is submitted to us and what happens when a User Report is submitted, please see About blocking and reporting contacts.\\\\n\\\\n- Third-Party Services. WhatsApp receives information about bad actors and abuse from Meta Companies and app verification information from anti-abuse services to promote safety, security and integrity. For example, when Meta becomes aware of a scam encouraging individuals to contact a phone number via WhatsApp, they might share that phone number with WhatsApp so we can investigate the WhatsApp account. We also allow you to use our Services in connection with third-party services and Meta Company Products. If you use our Services with such third-party services or Meta Company Products, we may receive information about you from them; for example, if you use the WhatsApp share button on a news service to share a news article with your WhatsApp contacts, groups, or broadcast lists on our Services. Please note that when you use third-party services or Meta Company Products, the terms and privacy policies of the company that offers those services will govern your use of those services and products.\\\\n\\\\n### Information Shared by You and by WhatsApp with Third Parties\\\\n\\\\nYou share your information as you use and communicate through our Services, and we share your information to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customise and support our Services.\\\\n\\\\n- Send Your Information To Those With Whom You Choose To Communicate. You share User Content when you communicate through our Services. You are in control of what you are sending when you send your information to the individual or business WhatsApp users you choose to communicate with. Please be mindful that, once you have sent User Content to a WhatsApp user, they can store or reshare it with others on and off our Services.\\\\n\\\\n- Third-Party Services. When you, or other users you interact with, use third-party services or other Meta Company Products that are linked through our Services, the providers of those services or products may receive the information about you that you or others share with them. For example, if you use a data backup service integrated with our Services (like iCloud or Google Drive), they will receive the information you share with them, such as your WhatsApp messages, and if you search the web from WhatsApp for a group profile picture, the search engine provider will receive the search term you use. If you interact with a third-party service or other Meta Company Products through our Services, such as when you use the in-app player to play content from a third-party platform like YouTube or Facebook, information like your IP address and technical information showing that the request comes from a WhatsApp app, may be provided to the provider of such service or products. Please note that when you use third-party services or other Meta Company Products, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those services and products.\\\\n\\\\n- Third-Party Service Providers.

They can't hear you yet (allegedly encrypted chats) but they can see everything else: what you eat, where you shop, they browse through your trash, look into the parcels you receive, can see who visits you (their names, addresses, etc), what apps do you use, how much is on your credit card.All this can be profiled, compared to the other millions and enriched with probable other details, e.g. if 100mln others bought a bucket and a shovel, when you buy a bucket you definitely want a shovel too. When 1000 people with the same details as you are criminals, than you are most likely a criminal too.\\\\n\\\\n*Upvotes: 472*\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Read More: WhatsApp Has Shared Your Data With Facebook for Years, Actually ...

DO NOT EDIT. ======================================================\\\\n\\\\nthis file is generated from src/style.less\\\\n\\\\nOpinionThe Privacy Project Google’s 4,000-Word Privacy Policy Is a Secret History of the Internet By Charlie Warzel and Ash Ngu Illustrated by Rose Wong\\\\n\\\\nThe late 1990s was a simpler time for Google. The nascent company was merely a search engine, and Gmail, Android and YouTube were but glimmers in the startup’s eye. Google’s first privacy policy reflected that simplicity. It was short and earnest, a quaint artifact of a different time in Silicon Valley, when Google offered 600 words to explain how it was collecting and using personal information.\\\\n\\\\nThat version of the internet (and Google) is gone. Over the past 20 years, that same privacy policy has been rewritten into a sprawling 4,000-word explanation of the company’s data practices.\\\\n\\\\nThis evolution, across two decades and 30 versions, is the story of the internet’s transformation through the eyes of one of its most crucial entities. The web is now terribly complex, and Google has a privacy policy to match.\\\\n\\\\nGoogle’s Privacy Policy Over Time 1999 Google is sensitive to the privacy concerns of its users. The Internet allows individuals to explore and communicate with unprecedented ease, but it also allows websites to collect and distribute personal information with equal ease. We at Google know that many users are, understandably, concerned about such practices, and we wish to make clear our policy for collecting and using personal information. Google’s Policy Google’s policy on our wholly controlled and operated Internet sites is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. Google does not willfully disclose individually identifiable information about its customers to any third party without first receiving that customer’s permission. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it. Google may share information about users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we only talk about our users in aggregate, not as individuals. For example, we may disclose how frequently the average Google user visits Google, or which other query words are most often used with the query word “Microsoft.” From time to time, there may be situations where Google asks you for personal information. When we intend to use your personal information, we tell you up front. This way you can decide whether you want to give us the information or not. In case you change your mind or some personal information changes, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us. Google and Cookies Upon your first visit to Google, Google sends a “cookie” to your computer. A cookie is a file that identifies you as a unique user. It can also store personal preferences and user data. A cookie can tell us, “This is the same individual who visited Google two days ago” but it cannot tell us, “This person is Joe Smith” or even, “This person lives in the United States.” Google uses cookies to track user trends and patterns, in order to better understand our user base and to improve the quality of our service. Google may also choose to use cookies to store user preferences. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of Google may not function properly if you refuse cookies. Links to Other Sites The page that comes up after “clicking” on a result URL is likely to be outside the Google site and beyond our control. Other links, such as for the Google-friends mailing list archive, are also on sites not controlled by Google. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Google may choose to exhibit its search results in the form of a “URL redirecter.” When a URL redirecter is used, whenever you “click” on a URL from a search result, information about the “click” is sent to Google, which then sends you to the site you clicked on. Google uses this URL information to understand and improve the quality of Google’s search technology. For instance, Google uses this information to determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results. Google’s policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Google’s control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. We reserve the right at our discretion to make changes to this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. 2009 At Google we recognize that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by Google Inc. or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies except DoubleClick (DoubleClick Privacy Policy) and Postini (Postini Privacy Policy); collectively, Google’s “services.” In addition, where more detailed information is needed to explain our privacy practices, we post supplementary privacy notices to describe how particular services process personal information. These notices can be found in the Google Privacy Center. Google adheres to the US Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement, and is registered with the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor Program. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us through our website or write to us at Privacy Matters c/o Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, California, 94043 USA Information we collect and how we use it We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information to us, such as Google Search. In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information: Information you provide – When you sign up for a Google Account or other Google service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password). For certain services, such as our advertising programs, we also request credit card or other payment account information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers. We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other Google services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information. Cookies – When you visit Google, we send one or more cookies – a small file containing a string of characters – to your computer or other device that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, improving search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends, such as how people search. Google also uses cookies in its advertising services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. We may set one or more cookies in your browser when you visit a website, including Google sites that use our advertising cookies, and view or click on an ad supported by Google’s advertising services. Log information – When you access Google services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. User communications – When you send email or other communications to Google, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. Affiliated Google Services on other sites – We offer some of our services on or through other web sites. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to Google in order to deliver the service. We process such information under this Privacy Policy. The affiliated sites through which our services are offered may have different privacy practices and we encourage you to read their privacy policies. Gadgets – Google may make available third party applications through its services. The information collected by Google when you enable a gadget or other application is processed under this Privacy Policy. Information collected by the application or gadget provider is governed by their privacy policies. Location data – Google offers location-enabled services, such as Google Maps for mobile. If you use those services, Google may receive information about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate a location (such as a cell ID). Links – Google may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality of our search technology, customized content and advertising. Read more information about links and redirected URLs. Other sites – This Privacy Policy applies to Google services only. We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as search results, sites that include Google applications, products or services, or links from within our various services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Google only processes personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and/or the supplementary privacy notices for specific services. In addition to the above, such purposes include: Providing our services, including the display of customized content and advertising; Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services; Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; Protecting the rights or property of Google or our users; and Developing new services. You can find more information about how we process personal information by referring to the supplementary privacy notices for particular services. Google processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country. We may process personal information to provide our own services. In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising partners. Choices for personal information When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service privacy notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the supplementary service privacy notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Google features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. Google uses the DoubleClick advertising cookie on AdSense partner sites and certain Google services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. You can view, edit, and manage your ads preferences associated with this cookie by accessing the Ads Preferences Manager. In addition, you may choose to opt out of the DoubleClick cookie at any time by using DoubleClick’s opt-out cookie. You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case Google may not be able to provide those services to you. Information sharing Google only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Google in the following limited circumstances: We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information. We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, its users or the public as required or permitted by law. If Google becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually. Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data. Information security We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. Data integrity Google processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services or as otherwise permitted under this Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary. Accessing and updating personal information When you use Google services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users’ personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services. Enforcement Google regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or Google’s treatment of personal information by contacting us through this web site or by writing to us at Privacy Matters c/o Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, California, 94043 USA When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is Google’s policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Google and an individual. Changes to this Privacy Policy Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). Each version of this Privacy Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and we will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review. If you have any additional questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us any time through this web site or at 2019 When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.

Effective January 22, 2019 | Archived versions | Download PDF We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include: Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads and embedded Google Maps You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used. To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us. INFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls. When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions. When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information. Things you create or provide to us When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services. We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.

We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request. We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and which apps you've installed. Your activity We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like.

You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account. Go to Google Account Your location information We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions for your weekend getaway or showtimes for movies playing near you. Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by: GPS IP address Sensor data from your device Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Google’s Policy Google’s policy on our wholly controlled and operated Internet sites is to respect and protect the privacy of our users.

And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\\\\n\\\\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\\\\n\\\\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\\\\n\\\\n# Why Google collects data\\\\n\\\\n## We use data to build better services\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\\\\n\\\\n### Provide our services\\\\n\\\\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\\\\n\\\\n### Maintain & improve our services\\\\n\\\\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\\\\n\\\\n### Develop new services\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\\\\n\\\\n### Provide personalized services, including content and ads\\\\n\\\\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\\\\n\\\\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\\\\n\\\\n- We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\\\\n\\\\nGo to My Ad Center\\\\n\\\\n### Measure performance\\\\n\\\\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\\\\n\\\\n### Communicate with you\\\\n\\\\n### Protect Google, our users, and the public\\\\n\\\\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\\\\n\\\\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\\\\n\\\\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.\\\\n\\\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\\\\n\\\\n# Your privacy controls\\\\n\\\\n## You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\\\\n\\\\nGo to Privacy Checkup\\\\n\\\\n## Managing, reviewing, and updating your information\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.\\\\n\\\\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:\\\\n\\\\n### Privacy controls\\\\n\\\\n### Activity Controls\\\\n\\\\nDecide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\\\\n\\\\nGo to Activity Controls\\\\n\\\\n### Ad settings\\\\n\\\\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.

You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.\\\\n\\\\n- Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\\\\n\\\\n# Sharing your information\\\\n\\\\n## When you share your information\\\\n\\\\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.\\\\n\\\\n## When Google shares your information\\\\n\\\\nWe do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:\\\\n\\\\n### With your consent\\\\n\\\\nWe’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.\\\\n\\\\n### With domain administrators\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:\\\\n\\\\n- Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email\\\\n\\\\n- View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install\\\\n\\\\n- Change your account password\\\\n\\\\n- Suspend or terminate your account access\\\\n\\\\n- Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request\\\\n\\\\n- Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings\\\\n\\\\n### For external processing\\\\n\\\\n### For legal reasons\\\\n\\\\nWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\\\\n\\\\n- Respond to any applicable law, regulation,legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.\\\\n\\\\n- Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.\\\\n\\\\n- Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public.\\\\n\\\\nWe may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.\\\\n\\\\n# Keeping your information secure\\\\n\\\\n## We build security into our services to protect your information\\\\n\\\\nAll Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.\\\\n\\\\nWe work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:\\\\n\\\\n- We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit\\\\n\\\\n- We offer a range of security features, like Safe Browsing, Security Checkup, and 2 Step Verification to help you protect your account\\\\n\\\\n- We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems\\\\n\\\\n- We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.\\\\n\\\\n# Exporting & deleting your information\\\\n\\\\nYou can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your content from specific Google services\\\\n\\\\n- Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\\\\n\\\\n- Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\\\\n\\\\n- Delete your entire Google Account\\\\n\\\\n# Retaining your information\\\\n\\\\nWe retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:\\\\n\\\\n- Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your personal info or the content you create or upload, like photos and documents. You can also delete activity information saved in your account, or choose to have it deleted automatically after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.\\\\n\\\\n- Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as advertising data in server logs.\\\\n\\\\n- We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.\\\\n\\\\n- And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.\\\\n\\\\n# Compliance & cooperation with regulators\\\\n\\\\n## Data transfers\\\\n\\\\nWe maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data.\\\\n\\\\nWhen we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.\\\\n\\\\n## U.S. state law requirements\\\\n\\\\nSome U.S. state privacy laws require specific disclosures.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain the categories of information Google collects and the sources of that information in Information Google collects.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain the purposes for which Google collects and uses information in Why Google collects data.\\\\n\\\\n- We explain when Google may disclose information in Sharing your information. Google does not sell your personal information. Google also does not “share” your personal information as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\\\\n\\\\n- We explain how Google retains information in Retaining your information. You can also learn more about how Google anonymizes data. As described there, when Google anonymizes data to protect your privacy, we maintain policies and technical measures to avoid re-identifying that information.\\\\n\\\\nU.S. state privacy laws also provide the right to request information about how Google collects, uses, and discloses your information. And they give you the right to access your information, sometimes in a portable format; correct your information; and to request that Google delete that information. Many of these laws also provide the right to opt out of certain forms of profiling and targeted advertising.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy.

The first time you turn on Location History — which is off by default — your auto-delete option will be set to 18 months by default. Web & App Activity auto-delete will also default to 18 months for new accounts. This means your activity data will be automatically and continuously deleted after 18 months, rather than kept until you choose to delete it.

If you do not agree to these Terms, then do not access or use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms.”\\\\n\\\\nThe wording here includes a sentence that’s currently buried further down in the terms, making it clear that by using its apps, you are indeed agreeing to these terms.\\\\n\\\\nThe update also includes more specific explanations around misuse of Meta’s apps, and the scraping of data from them.\\\\n\\\\n“You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data you do not have permission to access, regardless of whether such automated access or collection is undertaken while logged-in to a Facebook account.”\\\\n\\\\nThat last sentence has been added, clarifying that you can’t use the fact that you were logged into Facebook as an excuse for data scraping. This distinction, between logged in and logged out access, has been used in the legal defense of some scraping cases.\\\\n\\\\nThere’s also a new explanation about circumventing Meta’s protection measures, and how that’s also a no-no.\\\\n\\\\nMeta’s also included some specific qualifiers on avatar and AI use, based on its separate agreements for each:\\\\n\\\\n“If you use Avatars, then the Avatar Terms also apply. If you use our AI products and features, the Meta AI Terms also apply. To the extent any supplemental terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAs noted, the references to its separate Avatar and Meta AI terms here are new, ensuring that these documents, which already exist, are also specifically noted within the initial user agreement.\\\\n\\\\nMeta’s Avatar and AI terms cover the use of your personal data inputs for these elements, including, say, selfie videos for avatar creation, or the sharing of your conversations with Meta’s AI tools with third parties.\\\\n\\\\nWhy would Meta need to share your AI chats? Well, it might need to pass on your query to Google or Bing to get search results from the web, though the terms also cover any internal reviews of your AI prompts and other usage.\\\\n\\\\nSo there’s a range of things that you’re agreeing to, which are not new, as such, but are now being more explicitly built into Meta’s usage agreements.\\\\n\\\\nOn its Community Standards, Meta’s not actually updating the document, but it is merging its Community Standards that cover Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and Threads into one central location for easier access.\\\\n\\\\nSo if you see this new prompt, now you’ll know what it is you’re agreeing to.\\\\n\\\\n- purchase licensing rights\\\\n\\\\n### Social Media Today news delivered to your inbox\\\\n\\\\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\\\\n\\\\n- Retrieved from Daniel Oberhaus/Wikimedia Commons on April 18, 2022 Tracker The Complete Elon Musk–Twitter Saga For months, we’ve been tracking Elon Musk’s $44 billion deal with Twitter.

This publication represents our company’s views on AI and creativity.\\\\n\\\\n--\\\\n\\\\nDid you get an email from the Zuck this morning? I did and if you’re one of the billions still roaming around the social network that defined so much of our modern perspective, you should really read up on the changes.\\\\n\\\\nBut who in the world has time for that? So, my friend ChatPDF and I are here to help. Yes, this is what we at Credtent.org call an AI-Assisted piece of content because I used ChatPDF to help analyze the update and find some bugaboos that might be worth a second look. This is what I often tell people — use AI to help protect yourself against AI.\\\\n\\\\nLet me disclose clearly that I am not an attorney and this is NOT legal advice. It’s just what a read of the TOS changes means from both an AI’s analysis and my own personal take on this coming from the perspective of someone whose life and work (as Credtent’s founder) is focused on making sure content creators are protected in the Age of AI. I’d note that ChatGPT’s Canvas helped me organize my thoughts as well, but I’ve rewritten most of its output because I’m a writer, not an #AISlacker. Still, this qualifies as AI-Assisted Content because I used AI as my collaborator.\\\\n\\\\nNow, with the disclosures out of the way, here’s the meat of the article.\\\\n\\\\nBelow, you’ll see an outline of what’s changing, what it means for you, and why you might want to reconsider your relationship with the platform. Sound like a good time? No, not really. But I hope this proves easier than parsing the legalese yourself.\\\\n\\\\n## What’s Changing?\\\\n\\\\nHere’s a breakdown of the major updates compared to the existing terms:\\\\n\\\\n- Data Usage: Facebook emphasizes that it doesn’t sell personal data but uses it extensively to deliver targeted ads and sponsored content. They also admit to leveraging advanced technologies (hello, AI!) for “research and development”. What could go wrong there?\\\\n\\\\n- Legacy Contacts: You can now appoint someone to manage your account posthumously. This sounds convenient and, to be honest, I’ve found it painful to see the occasional suggestion of a friend who I know has passed. But it opens the door to new privacy concerns, post-mortem.\\\\n\\\\n- Unilateral Terms Updates: By simply using the platform, you consent to any future changes. In other words, your agreement is automatic — whether or not you like the changes. If you stay on FB, you don’t need to accept terms — you’re opting in automagically.\\\\n\\\\n- Content Rights: Facebook retains broad rights over content you upload, including intellectual property. While it’s unclear how far this stretches, it raises questions about whether your creative work could be appropriated for purposes like AI training to produce work based on your own. We’ve already seen how FB content has been used in advertising without compensation or credit. This could get much worse.\\\\n\\\\n## Concerns for Content Creators\\\\n\\\\nIf you create content, Facebook’s new terms should raise a bright red flag. Here’s why:\\\\n\\\\n- AI Training Ambiguity: Meta admits to using AI and machine learning but stops short of specifying whether your content is used for training purposes. This lack of transparency leaves creators vulnerable to their work being exploited. Based on the past history of this and, frankly, most technology platforms, I’d be inclined to not trust this omission as being innocent.\\\\n\\\\n- Intellectual Property: While you retain ownership of your content, Facebook’s broad license to “use” it creates a gray area. What stops them from repurposing your video or photo for marketing campaigns — or worse, feeding it into an AI model to allows for creation of content that is competitive to your own?\\\\n\\\\n- Control Erosion: By continuing to use the platform, you implicitly are agreeing to future terms, giving Facebook a blank check to rewrite the rules as they see fit. Again, what could go wrong? We can’t know!\\\\n\\\\n## What’s at Stake for All Users\\\\n\\\\nEven if you’re not a content creator worried about your work being used against your future success, there’s still plenty to worry about:\\\\n\\\\n- Privacy: Meta claims it protects user privacy, but vague language about data analysis and AI leaves you wondering how much of your information is truly secure.\\\\n\\\\n- Account Management: Accounts can be (and have been) disabled (by Meta) for unclear violations. What happens to years of uploaded content if you’re suddenly locked out? This already happened to me once because of a scam. I tried to contact support but Meta made it nigh impossible to do anything about it — although scammers kept writing to me saying they could restore it for a fee. That’s some excellent customer service, huh?\\\\n\\\\n- Transparency: The absence of clear disclosures about AI training practices sets a dangerous precedent for big tech. If Facebook doesn’t explicitly outline its policies, who will? This is a bigger deal than you might think if you’re posting all kinds of pictures of yourself, your children, and your home.\\\\n\\\\n## Long-Term Repercussions\\\\n\\\\nSticking with Facebook post-2025 might begin to feel like maintaining access to a popular party or tribe while sacrificing your autonomy. The long-term risks include:\\\\n\\\\n- AI Entrapment: Your creative content could be mined to improve AI tools, with no opt-out clause. Imagine contributing to technology that competes with or devalues your own work. That said, Credtent.org IS sending opt-out requests to Meta for registered Credtent users. The legal fight over this dicey policy is coming so we’re preparing users for it.\\\\n\\\\n- Data Monopoly: The more data Facebook collects, the stronger its grip on user behavior and advertising markets. Users could face fewer alternatives as competitors struggle to keep up. Worse, how much (and how often) will Facebook sell their information to adtech and data brokers that can extrapolate a lot about you from your behavior. However much information you think is out there about you, let me be blunt — it’s 10X worse.\\\\n\\\\n- Legal Precedents: If unchecked, Facebook’s practices may influence other platforms to adopt similar, creator-unfriendly terms. I can’t imagine anybody wanting BlueSky, Medium and other sensible platforms to edge into these terms over time because we were just accepting them getting worse and worse.\\\\n\\\\n## What Should You Do?\\\\n\\\\nHere are some actionable strategies to start today to better protect yourself:\\\\n\\\\n- Diversify Platforms: Share your work on platforms like BlueSky, which explicitly refuses to train on user content, or Medium for long-form writing. This is what I am doing now. I’m also on Substack, although you need to directly opt-out of their use of your work for AI training.\\\\n\\\\n- Minimize Uploads: Use Facebook to post links to your external content rather than uploading original files directly. FB’s algorithm dings you for outbound links but it’s probably worth it in the end.\\\\n\\\\n- Monitor Updates: Keep an eye on Meta’s future changes and reconsider your use of the platform as needed. If it’s still worth it to you, have at it. For me, the camel’s back was broken years ago. I’m just getting tired of the pile of straw gathering on the poor thing.\\\\n\\\\n- Advocate for Regulation: Push for transparency and ethical AI practices in the tech industry. Your voice matters. Join Credtent.org to help fight back against unethical AI theft of your person and content.\\\\n\\\\n## Now is time to say goodbye to Meta\\\\n\\\\nMeta’s new terms make one thing clear: Using Facebook in 2025 comes with a huge knot of strings attached. Whether you’re a content creator or just someone who values privacy, now is the time to rethink your digital footprint. The platform may remain convenient (and “free” unless you’re an advertiser), but the cost — measured in rights and data — is higher than ever.\\\\n\\\\nFor me, I’m reducing my footprint to just posting links to my personal work elsewhere.

You may need to add your Meta account and other account types (such as a Facebook or Instagram account) to the same Accounts Center in order to access certain features or services offered by Meta Company Products (for example, you may need to add your Meta account to the same Accounts Center as your Facebook account in order to share content from a MPT Product on Facebook). If you choose to use these Meta Company Products, your use of them is subject to the relevant terms and conditions, including minimum age requirements, for those Meta Company Products (including relevant data policies).\\\\n\\\\n2. Your Commitments to Meta and Our Community\\\\n\\\\n2.1. Your responsibility for your use of MPT Products.

Unless we are prohibited from restricting you under applicable law, you also may not reverse engineer any of the MPT Products or try to derive any of the software used in the MPT Products. You are also responsible for complying with all applicable laws when using MPT Products, including providing any notice to or obtaining any consents from other individuals who you interact with on your MPT Products as may be required under video recording, audio recording, biometric data, or other privacy or data protection laws. You are responsible for using your MPT Products in a safe, lawful, and respectful manner. For example, you may not tamper with the MPT Products, or otherwise obscure or modify any features that are intended to signal to others that the product is recording.\\\\n\\\\n2.3. Your responsibility for other users of your MPT Product. Each person, including you, who uses your MPT Product is referred to in these Supplemental Terms as a user of such products.

You are responsible for determining that your child is ready to use MPT Products, consistent with the Health and Safety Warnings (see 5.5.d).

You are responsible for the activities of your child when they use a Meta account to access MPT Products, and for their compliance with these Supplemental Terms. You are responsible for supervising your child’s access to and use of MPT Products. You are responsible for ensuring your child understands these Supplemental Terms as well as other Terms and Policies that may apply, such as the Code of Conduct for Virtual Experiences, and ensuring they understand how to behave and interact with others when accessing MPT Products.\\\\n\\\\n3. The Permissions You Give Us\\\\n\\\\n3.3. Permission to use your name, profile picture, and information about your actions with ads and sponsored or commercial content. You give us permission to use your profile name, profile picture, and information about actions you have taken in MPT Products (for example, apps you use) next to or in connection with ads, offers, and other sponsored or commercial content that we display in MPT Products without any compensation to you. Additionally, if you choose to connect your Meta account with other Meta Company Products accounts (such as your Facebook or Instagram accounts), you also give us permission to display your profile information and information about actions you have taken in MPT Products across Meta Company Products. Ads and content like this can be seen only by people who have your permission to see the actions you've taken in MPT Products consistent with your privacy settings.\\\\n\\\\n4. What You Can Share and Do on MPT Products\\\\n\\\\n4.1. Permission to use. If your MPT Product includes software applications, content, or virtual items other than Third-Party Services (“Software and Content”) that have been enabled for your use, we hereby grant you a personal, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited right and license to access, use, and download (as permitted by the functionality of the MPT Products) that Software and Content on MPT Products devices you own or control, solely for personal non-commercial purposes (except as expressly authorized by Meta in writing), conditioned on your compliance with these Supplemental Terms. Any unauthorized use of the MPT Products, including the Software and Content, is strictly prohibited and will cause the license granted in these Supplemental Terms to terminate automatically. No licenses or rights are granted to you by implication or otherwise, except for the licenses and rights expressly granted to you herein or in any other applicable terms. The Software and Content are the property of Meta, its affiliates, or its licensors, and are only licensed, not sold to you. Meta also requires that you use only the then-current version of the Software and Content.\\\\n\\\\n4.2. Third-Party Services. MPT Products can be used to access software, applications, services, content, and virtual items (including, but not limited to, third-party digital content, additional or enhanced functionality, or media content purchased through MPT Products) provided by third parties (“Third-Party Services”). In some cases, Meta or its affiliates may distribute Third-Party Services to you on behalf of the third party.\\\\n\\\\n4.2.a. Third-Party Terms. Your use of a Third-Party Service may be subject to additional terms, conditions, fees, and policies imposed by the third party (together, “Third-Party Terms”). Meta is not a party to these Third-Party Terms. However, in the event that Third-Party Terms conflict with the provisions of these Supplemental Terms, these Supplemental Terms will govern. You are responsible for complying with any applicable Third-Party Terms, and we recommend that you review any applicable Third-Party Terms before using Third-Party Services. We have no obligations or liability for (i) your access to or use of any Third-Party Services, (ii) any information that you provide or authorize us to provide to any Third-Party Services, or (iii) such third party’s collection, use, or disclosure of such information. If you have connected to a Third-Party Service on a MPT Product, you may remain connected using saved credentials unless you take action to discontinue access to that service (such as by changing the applicable account settings for the relevant Third-Party Service).\\\\n\\\\n4.2.b. Default End User License. If you are not presented with an end user license agreement when you acquire Third-Party Services, the following license terms apply to your use of such Third-Party Services: (a) the third party providing the Third-Party Services (and not Meta or its affiliates) is the licensor of such Third-Party Services; (b) such third party grants you a limited, non-transferable license to access and use the Third-Party Services only for your personal and non-commercial purposes; and (c) you may not modify, decompile or disassemble the Third-Party Services in whole or in part, or create any derivative works from or sublicense any rights in or to the Third-Party Services, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the third party or as permitted under applicable law notwithstanding these restrictions. Meta and its affiliates are not parties to the license agreement between you and the provider of such Third-Party Services or other Third-Party Terms.\\\\n\\\\n4.2.c. Discontinuation of Third-Party Services. Third-Party Services may require access to data about Meta users and Meta services, which access is subject to agreements between Third-Party Service providers and Meta. We may disable this access for a Third-Party Service if the Third-Party Service provider breaches these agreements, our policies, or applicable law, or if the agreements are otherwise terminated. This may adversely affect your use of such Third-Party Services, including by making such Third-Party Services partially or fully inoperable. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we will have no liability to you for removing or disabling access to data and services by a third party for these reasons. This means, without limitation, that Meta will not provide you with any refunds for such Third-Party Services in these cases. Any rights, including refund claims, which you may have under your agreements with third parties remain unaffected.\\\\n\\\\n4.4. Objectionable Content. We may display age, comfort, and content ratings for digital content (including ads) that are based on information provided to us by the developers of such content, and which are not verified by Meta, unless expressly mentioned. We cannot guarantee that digital content ratings will always be accurate, nor can we promise that you will not find some material harmful, inappropriate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable, including material that may be found through accessing third-party links or other Third-Party Services. You understand that you may be exposed to content from a variety of sources when using MPT Products and acknowledge that content may be inaccurate, inappropriate, offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable. You agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Meta will not be responsible or liable for content posted by you, other users of MPT Products, or a third party.\\\\n\\\\n4.5. Age Restrictions. You may only access certain digital content if you are of or above the age displayed to you when you order the digital content. If we determine that you did not comply with these age requirements, we may disable your access to the digital content and we will not refund the amounts paid for the digital content.\\\\n\\\\n5. Additional Provisions\\\\n\\\\n5.1. Functionality may change or be limited. We work constantly to improve MPT Products and respond to changing needs of our community. As part of this continual improvement, we may introduce new features or services, impose limits on, change, suspend, disable, remove, replace, update, upgrade, roll back, or restrict access to features, services, software, content or any part of MPT Products (including Meta Products or Meta Company Products). If a feature, service, software or content is no longer available, or if a technical error occurs, information, data, or content created or provided by you in connection with such feature, service, software or content may be deleted or become inaccessible, and you should not exclusively rely on any feature, service, software or content to store or preserve such information, data or content. In addition, certain features, services, software or content may be disabled or made available in modified form based on your age or location. We may offer free trials or other limited versions of the MPT Products so that you can preview these products before purchase. These versions may have limited features, restrict the permitted time of use and contain other limitations. The features, functionality, or availability of a Third-Party Service may change or be discontinued, including if the developer of such Third-Party Service violates our terms or policies, or in accordance with the Terms or the applicable Third-Party Terms.\\\\n\\\\n5.3. Updates to these Supplemental Terms. These Supplemental Terms may be updated from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices, to promote a safe and secure experience on the MPT Products, and/or comply with applicable law. Unless the changes are required by law, we will notify you before we make changes to these Supplemental Terms or any Commercial Terms (if the changes are applicable to the MPT Products used by you), and give you an opportunity to review the updated terms before they go into effect. We hope that you will continue using MPT Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Supplemental Terms, you must cease use of MPT Products. Your continued use of MPT Products after the effective date of the updated Supplemental Terms constitutes your acceptance of those terms.\\\\n\\\\n5.4. Third-Party Fees and Costs. You are responsible for the fees, costs, and other charges, such as internet usage or utilities fees, associated with use of MPT Products, as well as fees, costs, and other charges associated with Third-Party Services.\\\\n\\\\n5.5. Disclaimers; Limitations of Liability; Indemnification.\\\\n\\\\n5.5.b. Unless a separate limited warranty is provided, certain hardware products of the MPT Products are covered by the Limited Warranty offered by Meta Platforms Technologies, LLC. Nothing in these Supplemental Terms is intended to either abridge or expand the scope of those limited warranties.\\\\n\\\\n5.5.c. Certain MPT Products may have communication or calling capabilities. However, there are important differences between such MPT Products and a mobile or fixed-line telephone service. MPT Products do not provide access to emergency services or emergency service providers (including the police, fire departments, or hospitals), or otherwise connect to public safety answering points. You should ensure you can contact your relevant emergency service providers through a mobile telephone, fixed-line telephone, or other service.\\\\n\\\\n5.5.d. THERE ARE IMPORTANT HEALTH AND SAFETY WARNINGS, INFORMATION, AND INSTRUCTIONS (“HEALTH AND SAFETY WARNINGS”) THAT YOU MUST READ BEFORE USING MPT PRODUCTS OR ALLOWING YOUR CHILD TO USE MPT PRODUCTS, AVAILABLE HERE. THESE INCLUDE WARNINGS, INFORMATION, AND INSTRUCTIONS THAT A PARENT OR GUARDIAN MUST REVIEW AND CONSIDER BEFORE DETERMINING THAT THEIR CHILD IS READY FOR MPT PRODUCTS AND SETTING UP AN ACCOUNT ON THEIR BEHALF. WARNING: FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE HEALTH AND SAFETY WARNINGS AND INSTRUCTIONS MAY RESULT IN DAMAGE TO MPT PRODUCTS OR ACCESSORIES, AND MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, DISCOMFORT OR OTHER POTENTIAL HAZARDS. BY USING MPT PRODUCTS, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE REVIEWED THESE WARNINGS AND INSTRUCTIONS AND ENSURE THAT ALL USERS OF YOUR MPT PRODUCTS READ AND UNDERSTAND THE HEALTH AND SAFETY WARNINGS AND INSTRUCTIONS (AND WILL REVIEW ANY UPDATES THERETO), AND WILL ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH WARNINGS AND INSTRUCTIONS.\\\\n\\\\n5.5.e. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold harmless Meta and its affiliates from and against all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your purchase or use of the MPT Products; (ii) your actual or alleged breach of these Supplemental Terms or any other applicable terms, policies, warnings or instructions provided by Meta or a third party in relation to the MPT Products; (iii) your violation of any applicable law or any rights of any third party; (iv) any content you provide, upload, or transmit while using MPT Products, or (v) any access to or use of MPT Products by any third party to whom you have made available MPT Products access or use. In the event that you provide Meta’s defense to such a claim, you agree that Meta (a) shall be consulted regarding, and shall have the right to approve (at our sole discretion), defense strategy, any appeal, and any settlement of the claim, (b) shall have the right to select defense counsel, and (c) may further participate in the defense of the claim with counsel of our own choice at our own expense.\\\\n\\\\n5.6. Dispute Resolution.\\\\n\\\\nPLEASE READ THIS SECTION 5.6 CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT. THIS SECTION 5.6 REQUIRES YOU TO SUBMIT TO BINDING ARBITRATION ANY AND ALL DISPUTES (EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR BELOW) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS, OR ANY PERSONAL USE OF MPT PRODUCTS, AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.a. What claims must be arbitrated. Except as provided below, you and Meta agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or dispute between you and Meta arising out of or related to these Supplemental Terms, or the purchase or personal use of MPT Products (“claim(s)”) must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. By agreeing to arbitrate, you and Meta expressly waive the rights to sue in court and trial by jury. Our past, present, and future affiliates and agents, as well as any of our successors and assigns, can invoke our rights under this agreement in the event they become involved in a dispute.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.b. What claims won’t be arbitrated. Instead of using arbitration, you or Meta can bring claims in your local “small claims” court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don’t bring your claims in small claims court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. In addition, only a court may decide claims to enforce your or Meta’s intellectual property rights (like copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets) or resolve issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision or whether subsection 5.6.c (requiring individual arbitration), subsection 5.6.d (requiring pre-arbitration notice of disputes), or subsection 5.6.f (regarding coordinated arbitrations) have been violated. Moreover, nothing in these Terms will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief from us on your behalf.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.c. Arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and class arbitrations are not permitted; for example, you may bring a claim only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other users of MPT Products. Nor may an arbitrator consolidate arbitrations unless all parties agree. If there is a final judicial determination that the limitations of this paragraph are unenforceable as to a particular claim or a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief), then that claim or request for relief will be decided by a court after all other claims and requests for relief are arbitrated.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.d. Notice of claims before arbitration. Before you or Meta commence arbitration of a claim, the claimant must provide the other party with a written Notice of Dispute that includes your username, the claimant’s name and contact information, a detailed description of the dispute, the specific relief sought, and the claimant’s signature. If you send the Notice, it also must include your residence address (and mailing address if different), the email address and mobile phone number you use with your account, and if you are represented by an attorney, a signed statement authorizing Meta to discuss your account and share your confidential account information with your attorney. Any Notice of Dispute you send to Meta should be mailed to Meta Platforms, Inc., ATTN: MPT Arbitration Filing, 1 Meta Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025 (“Notice Address”). Before Meta commences arbitration, Meta will send you a Notice of Dispute to the email address you use with your account or when you access MPT Products or by other appropriate means. If you and we are unable to resolve a dispute within 60 days after a fully complete Notice of Dispute is received, you or Meta may commence arbitration, but neither party may commence an arbitration during this 60-day period. If any aspect of the requirements in this subsection have not been met, a court can enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations. In addition, unless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration provider cannot accept or administer the arbitration, nor assess any fees for such an arbitration. If the arbitration already is pending, it must be dismissed.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.e. How arbitration works. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by this arbitration provision. The AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules are available at https://www.adr.org or by writing to the Notice Address. If the AAA cannot or will not administer the arbitration in accordance with this arbitration provision, another arbitration provider will be selected by the parties or, if there is no agreement, by the court. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, unless the arbitrator determines that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel. The arbitrator may consider rulings in other arbitrations involving other claimants, but an arbitrator’s ruling will not be binding in proceedings involving different claimants. Except as provided in subsection 18.3, the arbitrator can award the same relief that a court can award under applicable law, including sanctions against any represented party or counsel permitted under the AAA rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), or other applicable federal or state law.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.e.1. Costs of arbitration. Meta will pay all AAA or arbitrator fees for any arbitration Meta brings. If you are assessed any such fees for any arbitration you bring, we will pay those fees on your behalf, so long as you have fully complied with subsections 5.6.c, 5.6.d, and 5.6.g and your claims seek relief valued at less than $75,000. In all cases, the arbitrator may reallocate these fees in accordance with the AAA’s rules regarding frivolous or improper claims or vexatious litigation.\\\\n\\\\n5.6.f. Arbitration of coordinated claims. If 25 or more claimants submit similar Notices of Dispute or file similar arbitrations and are represented by the same or coordinated counsel (regardless of whether the cases are pursued simultaneously), all of the cases must be resolved in arbitration in staged proceedings. You agree to this process even though it might delay the arbitration of your claim. In the first stage, claimants’ counsel and Meta will each select up to 25 cases (50 cases total) to be filed in arbitration and resolved individually by separate arbitrators. If feasible, arbitrators will be from the respective claimants’ home states.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"As stated in the Meta Terms of Service, we don’t sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don’t share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission.\\\",\\n      \\\"source\\\": \\\"web\\\",\\n      \\\"price\\\": 0.0015,\\n      \\\"length\\\": 24990,\\n      \\\"image_url\\\": {},\\n      \\\"relevance_score\\\": 0.8150897883604115,\\n      \\\"data_type\\\": \\\"unstructured\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Meta Platforms Technologies Products Commercial Terms | Meta Store\\\",\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.meta.com/legal/quest/commercial-terms/?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\\\",\\n      \\\"content\\\": \\\"Meta Platforms Technologies Products Commercial Terms\\\\n\\\\nIf you are an individual engaged in any commercial use of a MPT Product, you represent and warrant that you are not doing so as an individual consumer.

Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that Meta, in its sole discretion, may bring any claim it has against you related to efforts to abuse, interfere, or engage with MPT Products in unauthorized ways in any competent court in the jurisdiction in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the claim.We and you agree that, by entering into this arbitration provision, all parties are waiving their respective rights to a trial by jury or to participate in a class or representative action. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING COMMERCIAL CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING. For example, you may bring a Commercial Claim only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other parties. If there is a final judicial determination that any particular Commercial Claim (or a request for particular relief) cannot be arbitrated according to the limitations of this Section, then only that Commercial Claim (or only that request for relief) may be severed and brought in court. All other Commercial Claims (or requests for relief) will remain subject to this Section. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. All issues are for an arbitrator to decide, except that only a court may decide issues relating to the scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision or the interpretation of the prohibition of class and representative actions. If any party intends to seek arbitration of a dispute, that party must provide the other party with notice in writing. This notice of dispute to us must be sent to the following address: Meta Platforms, Inc., 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025. The arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”), as modified by these MPT Commercial Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. If the AAA is unavailable, the parties will agree to another arbitration provider or the court will appoint a substitute. The arbitrator will not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations in which you are not a party. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any evidentiary submissions made in arbitration will be maintained as confidential in the absence of good cause for its disclosure. The arbitrator’s award will be maintained as confidential only to the extent necessary to protect either party’s trade secrets or proprietary business information or to comply with a legal requirement mandating confidentiality. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA Rules, except that we will pay for your filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your Commercial Claim for damages does not exceed USD $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If you do not wish to be bound by this provision (including its waiver of class and representative claims), you must notify us as set forth below within 30 days of the first acceptance date of any version of these MPT Commercial Terms containing an arbitration provision (we note, for clarity, that the date on which you make your first commercial use of a MPT Product pursuant to these MPT Commercial Terms will constitute such acceptance date). Such notice to us must be submitted to the address here: Meta Platforms, Inc., 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025. All Commercial Claims between us, whether subject to arbitration or not, will be governed by California law, excluding California’s conflict of laws rules, except to the extent that California law is contrary to or preempted by U.S. federal law.\\\\n\\\\nThese MPT Commercial Terms may be updated from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices. If changes to these MPT Commercial Terms would adversely impact your commercial use of MPT Products or your responsibilities under these MPT Commercial Terms, we will notify you before we make such changes and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. We may also notify you in advance regarding other changes to these MPT Commercial Terms where required to do so by applicable law. We hope that you will continue using MPT Products, but if you do not agree to our updated MPT Commercial Terms, you must cease commercial use of MPT Products, and, if you are an entity, cause your employees and representatives to do the same. Your continued commercial use of MPT Products after the effective date of the updated MPT Commercial Terms constitutes your acceptance of those terms.\\\\n\\\\nThe Meta Products, including MPT Products, all related software, technical data, and documentation, are “Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items” as defined in Section 2.101 of Title 48 of the US Code of Federal Regulations. We provide the Meta Products for public sector end use, including U.S. Government end use, with the same rights as all other end users pursuant to these MPT Commercial Terms and the Supplemental Terms. If a public sector entity, including a U.S. Government entity, has a need for any additional rights, it must negotiate directly with us to determine if the parties can negotiate an acceptable amendment to these MPT Commercial Terms and the Supplemental Terms that must be included in any applicable contract or agreement.\\\\n\\\\nThese MPT Commercial Terms are effective until terminated and will terminate when the Supplemental Terms between you and us are terminated. Upon such termination, the provisions in Sections 6-17 of these MPT Commercial Terms will remain in place and survive termination.\\\\n\\\\nThe Terms (and any agreements incorporated by reference therein), make up the entire agreement between you and Meta regarding your commercial use of MPT Products, and supersede any prior agreements between you and us regarding such commercial use.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"These Meta Platforms Technologies Commercial Terms (“MPT Commercial Terms”) cover commercial use of MPT Products, and such commercial use is governed by the Meta Terms of Service (located at facebook.com/terms/), the Supplemental Meta Platforms Technologies Terms of Service (located at https://www.meta.com/legal/quest/updated-terms-of-service/), and these MPT Commercial Terms, which collectively form an agreement (“Terms”) between you and Meta Platforms, Inc.\\\",\\n      \\\"source\\\": \\\"web\\\",\\n      \\\"price\\\": 0.0015,\\n      \\\"length\\\": 19241,\\n      \\\"image_url\\\": {},\\n      \\\"relevance_score\\\": 0.7401826241578892,\\n      \\\"data_type\\\": \\\"unstructured\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"results_by_source\\\": {\\n    \\\"web\\\": 5,\\n    \\\"proprietary\\\": 0\\n  },\\n  \\\"total_deduction_pcm\\\": 7.5,\\n  \\\"total_deduction_dollars\\\": 0.0075,\\n  \\\"total_characters\\\": 59942\\n}\"}]}}, {\"toolResult\": {\"toolUseId\": \"valyu_search\", \"status\": \"success\", \"content\": [{\"text\": \"{\\n  \\\"success\\\": true,\\n  \\\"error\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"tx_id\\\": \\\"tx_994e2140-caa8-4cf2-8e4d-2b6c93ad6f41\\\",\\n  \\\"query\\\": \\\"Meta data policy\\\",\\n  \\\"results\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Metadata policy - Office for National Statistics\\\",\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/datastrategy/datapolicies/metadatapolicy?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\\\",\\n      \\\"content\\\": \\\"# Metadata policy\\\\n\\\\n## In this section\\\\n\\\\n- Scope\\\\n\\\\n- Background\\\\n\\\\n- Policy statement\\\\n\\\\n- Policy detail\\\\n\\\\n- Roles and responsibilities\\\\n\\\\nThis policy covers all the statistical data that the Office for National Statistics (ONS) holds either as a data controller or a data processor, including those obtained through surveys and from administrative sources in the private or public sectors. The policy is valid from data acquisition and collection by the ONS, and it also extends through the lifecycle up to and including data archiving and data disposal.\\\\n\\\\nThis policy applies to all UK Statistics Authority and ONS employees, including staff on fixed-term, temporary or permanent contract, staff on secondment, students and contractors.\\\\n\\\\nMetadata provide information about other data, including a description of the data. This includes information that provides context to the data (for example, how it was collected), or the coverage of the data (for example, publication date, description and search keywords).\\\\n\\\\nThe ONS needs to hold and manage a comprehensive set of unambiguous metadata relating to the data it manages, in order to understand the data, fully extract the value from the data and employ appropriate security measures to protect the data.\\\\n\\\\nThe ONS Data Strategy specifies data principles for managing data; data policies support the implementation of these principles. This metadata policy aligns with the data principles and underpins the management and governance of metadata in the ONS. The metadata must comply with the data principles.\\\\n\\\\nMetadata provide information about other data and are essential in aiding understanding of the data and ensuring that appropriate security measures are employed to protect the data. Metadata will be defined and centrally maintained for all data held by the ONS from acquisition to dissemination, archiving and disposal.\\\\n\\\\nAll data acquired and collected by the ONS from external and internal sources must be accompanied by metadata. The ONS Metadata Model defines the minimum set of metadata that must accompany all data acquired by the ONS. In practice, captured metadata will go beyond the defined minimum set of metadata. In order to provide a framework for managing metadata, metadata categories have been defined and all metadata will be categorised according to these categories.\\\\n\\\\nONS Information assets held on the Information and Data Asset Register will be assigned a Metadata Owner, in addition to the Information Asset Owner. The Metadata Owner will periodically review the quality of the metadata they own and will initiate corrective action to address any issues found with the accuracy and quality of the metadata.\\\\n\\\\nThe ONS Business Glossary holds definitions for the main terms used within the ONS. Glossary Term Owners are appointed at the time of data acquisition, creation or amendment, and are responsible for maintaining their terms, updating and consolidating them with other terms as appropriate.\\\\n\\\\n1.

We don't allow apps with misleading, improperly formatted, non-descriptive, irrelevant, excessive, or inappropriate metadata, including but not limited to the app's description, developer name, title, icon, screenshots, and promotional images. Developers must provide a clear and well-written description of their app. We also don't allow unattributed or anonymous user testimonials in the app's description. Your app title, icon, and developer name are particularly helpful for users to find and learn about your app. Don’t use emojis, emoticons, or repeated special characters in these metadata elements. Avoid ALL CAPS unless it is part of your brand name. Misleading symbols in app icons are not allowed, for example: new message dot indicator when there are no new messages and download/install symbols when the app is not related to downloading content. Your app title must be 30 characters or less. Don’t use text or image in the app title, icon, or developer name that indicate store performance or ranking, price or promotional information, or that suggests relations to existing Google Play programs. In addition to the requirements noted here, specific Google Play Developer Policies may require you to provide additional metadata information.\\\\n\\\\n## Examples of common violations\\\\n\\\\n① Unattributed or Anonymous User testimonials ② Data comparison of apps or brands ③ Word blocks and vertical/horizontal word lists\\\\n\\\\n① ALL CAPS although not part of brand name ② Special character sequences that are irrelevant to the app ③ Use of emojis, emoticons(including kaomojis), and special characters ④ Misleading symbol ⑤ Misleading text\\\\n\\\\n- Images or text that indicate store performance or ranking, such as 'App of the year,' '#1,' 'Best of Play 20XX,' 'Popular,' award icons, etc. - Images or text that indicate price and promotional information, such as '10% off,' '$50 cash back,' 'free for limited time only,' etc. - Images or text that indicate Google Play programs, such as 'Editor’s choice,' 'New,' etc.\\\\n\\\\n#### Here are some examples of inappropriate text, images, or videos within your listing:\\\\n\\\\n- Imagery or videos with sexually suggestive content. Avoid suggestive imagery containing breasts, buttocks, genitalia, or other fetishized anatomy or content, whether illustrated or real. - Using profane, vulgar, or other language that is inappropriate for a general audience in your app’s Store listing. - Graphic violence prominently depicted in app icons, promotional images, or videos. - Depictions of the illicit usage of drugs. Even EDSA (Educational, Documentary, Scientific, or Artistic) content must be suitable for all audiences within the store listing.\\\\n\\\\n#### Here are a few best practices:\\\\n\\\\n- Highlight what's great about your app. Share interesting and exciting facts about your app to help users understand what makes your app special. - Make sure that your app’s title and description accurately describe your app’s functionality. - Avoid using repetitive or unrelated keywords or references. - Keep your app’s description succinct and straightforward. Shorter descriptions tend to result in a better user experience, especially on devices with smaller displays. Excessive length, detail, improper formatting, or repetition can result in a violation of this policy. - Remember that your listing should be suitable for a general audience.

People from whom you collect content or information must explicitly consent to your use of their data. You must clearly explain that you (and not Meta) are collecting this data.\\\\n\\\\nIn order to be compliant, your policy must be up-to-date, understandable, unambiguous, and easily accessible. Also, it has to:\\\\n\\\\n- describe the personal data collected and the purposes of their collection; - accurately list all the third parties the data is shared with; and - inform users of their rights in relation to their data.\\\\n\\\\nSee this privacy policy created with [our generator](https://www.iubenda.com/en/privacy-and-cookie-policy-generator) for an example of how these elements come together. Click on the button to open the document:\\\\n\\\\nPrivacy Policy\\\\n\\\\n### Specify you’re using Page Insights and communicate your legal basis\\\\n\\\\nAs explained in Facebook’s [Data Policy](https://www.facebook.com/policy) under “How do we use this information?”, [Meta](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/13561-privacy-policy-for-facebook-apps) also collects and uses information to provide analytics services called[Page Insights](https://www.facebook.com/help/268680253165747) to Page admins to help them understand how people interact with their Pages and the content associated with them.\\\\n\\\\nAlso, you should communicate your legal basis:\\\\n\\\\n> You should ensure that you also have a legal basis for the processing of Insights data. In addition to the information provided to data subjects by Meta Ireland via the Information about Page Insights, you should identify your own legal basis including the legitimate interests you pursue\\\\n\\\\nYou can create your own custom clause to disclose your use of Page Insights. [Visit our page to learn more](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/386-how-to-add-a-custom-service-and-customize-to-your-needs).\\\\n\\\\nMost importantly, if [GDPR applies to your situation](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/5428#gdprApplies), do not forget to mention on which legal base you are relying on in order to process statistical data. You can rely on any of the[6 legal bases provided under the GDPR.](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/5428-gdpr-guide#1-legal-basis-for-processing-data)\\\\n\\\\n## Meta’s responsibilities\\\\n\\\\nAs stated in the [Page Insights Controller Addendum](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum), Meta is taking on major responsibilities:\\\\n\\\\n> Unless specified otherwise in this Page Insights Addendum, between you and Meta Ireland, Meta Ireland assumes the responsibility for compliance with the applicable obligations under the GDPR for the processing of Insights data (including, but not limited to, Articles 12 and 13 GDPR, Articles 15 to 21 GDPR, Articles 33 and 34 GDPR). Meta Ireland will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the processing in accordance with Article 32 GDPR.\\\\n\\\\n### Joint controllership\\\\n\\\\nThe processing of personal data for Page Insights might be subject to the joint controllership arrangement: basically, if you’re a Facebook Page admin, both you and Meta are responsible for complying with the [GDPR](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/5428) in relation to Meta’s Page Insights service.\\\\n\\\\nIn any case, there is **no need to add a joint controller statement**, since Meta takes care of this aspect:\\\\n\\\\n> Meta Ireland will make the essence of this Page Insights Addendum available to data subjects (Article 26(2) GDPR). This is currently done via the Information about Page Insights data which can be accessed from all Pages.\\\\n\\\\n### Facebook Page Insights Controller Addendum Requests\\\\n\\\\nIf you need assistance with regard to a request in accordance with the Page Insights Controller Addendum, you can [submit this form](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/308592359910928):\\\\n\\\\nIn fact, on the Page Insights Controller Addendum Meta says:\\\\n\\\\n> If data subjects exercise their rights under the GDPR with regard to the processing of Insights data against you (Article 26(3) GDPR), or you are contacted by a supervisory authority with regard to the processing of Insights data, each a “request”, you will forward all relevant information regarding such requests to us promptly but within a maximum of seven calendar days. For this purpose, you can submit this form. Meta Ireland agrees to answer requests from data subjects in accordance with our obligations under this Page Insights Addendum.

This is especially true if you use tools that connect your websites, apps, and marketing activities to Facebook.\\\\n\\\\n- What data Facebook collects\\\\n\\\\n- How Meta uses it\\\\n\\\\n- What steps you need to take to meet your legal obligations and be transparent with your customers\\\\n\\\\nIf your business decides how and why personal data is collected or used, then under many global privacy laws you are accountable starting from the moment you collect it, and even after it’s shared with third parties like Meta.\\\\n\\\\nUnderstanding what data Facebook collects and how Meta uses that data matters for several other reasons, detailed below.\\\\n\\\\n### Regulatory compliance\\\\n\\\\nMeta must use the data you share in a way that meets regulatory requirements. Data privacy laws generally protect data belonging to individuals located in the law’s region of jurisdiction — like many countries under the European Union, a single country like Canada, or a US state.\\\\n\\\\nYou may be required to comply with several laws, depending on where your audience or customers are located, and what industry your business is in. Some of the most common global privacy laws are:\\\\n\\\\n- The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\\\\n\\\\n- Multiple US state-level data privacy laws, including, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)\\\\n\\\\n- Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (LGPD)\\\\n\\\\n- South Africa’s Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA)\\\\n\\\\n- Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)\\\\n\\\\n### Customer expectations\\\\n\\\\nAccording to data from Salesforce, 71 percent of customers are increasingly protective of their personal information. That growing caution makes it more important than ever for businesses to be clear about who has access to users’ personal data and how it’s used.\\\\n\\\\nIf your practices aren’t transparent — or if users feel misled — it can erode trust and harm your reputation.\\\\n\\\\n### Business impact\\\\n\\\\nFacebook’s data policies influence how effective your ads and analytics will be. Understanding what data Facebook uses and how it processes that data helps you make better decisions about targeting, measurement, and spend.\\\\n\\\\n### Evolving regulations\\\\n\\\\nNewer laws like the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) restrict how Meta can combine and use EU users’ data collected from one product — like Facebook — across its ecosystem. Meta has multiple platforms and billions of users, so this is a notable restriction on the data and revenue potential in their operations.\\\\n\\\\nThese changes affect how your business can use Meta tools for audience insights, cross-platform tracking, and personalized advertising in the EU. That means ongoing awareness is necessary for continued compliance.\\\\n\\\\n## Understanding Facebook’s data privacy policies and practices\\\\n\\\\nFacebook processes large volumes of personal data that’s collected from both users and businesses that use Meta Business Tools on their websites and apps.\\\\n\\\\nIn some regions, Facebook may also use data collected from other Meta platforms — such as Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp — depending on local privacy laws and user consent.\\\\n\\\\nHere’s a look at what data Facebook collects and how it’s used.\\\\n\\\\n### What data does Facebook collect?\\\\n\\\\n- User-provided information: Includes details that users enter when creating an account or making a purchase, such as their email address, phone number, age, profile photo, and payment or delivery information if they use Meta Pay or checkout features.\\\\n\\\\n- User activity: Facebook tracks what users click, post, like, and share, as well as who they message and otherwise interact with. Engagement with both ads and organic content is tracked.\\\\n\\\\n- App, browser, and device information: Facebook collectsdata from users’ phones, computers, or tablets, including: Device type Operating system Battery level Signal strength IP address App version Network GPS location Photos and camera access\\\\n\\\\n- Device type\\\\n\\\\n- Operating system\\\\n\\\\n- Battery level\\\\n\\\\n- Signal strength\\\\n\\\\n- IP address\\\\n\\\\n- App version\\\\n\\\\n- Network\\\\n\\\\n- GPS location\\\\n\\\\n- Photos and camera access\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to this user data, Facebook receives personal data from the businesses that use its tools.\\\\n\\\\nIf your business integrates Meta Business Tools — such as the Facebook Pixel, SDK, or Conversions API — that means you’re actively sending data about your website or app visitors to Meta. This may include pages viewed, purchases completed, or in-app events triggered by users.\\\\n\\\\n### How do Facebook and Meta use this information?\\\\n\\\\n#### Personalization (including ads)\\\\n\\\\n#### Product improvement\\\\n\\\\nMeta applies user activity information to enhance existing products and develop new features. It also uses device information, such as what’s happening in the background when a Meta app crashes.\\\\n\\\\n#### Safety and security\\\\n\\\\nMeta uses this information to detect and prevent suspicious activity, harmful behavior, spam, and fraud, aiming to keep the platform safe for users and businesses.\\\\n\\\\n#### Measurement and analytics\\\\n\\\\nMeta provides businesses with analytics and reports on ad performance and user engagement. It often uses data shared by businesses through Business Tools.\\\\n\\\\n### Role of cookies and tracking technologies\\\\n\\\\nMeta uses cookies, pixels, and other tracking technologies to collect personal data for a range of uses, including analytics and ad targeting.\\\\n\\\\nFacebook uses these tools to gather information from people who have Facebook accounts, use other Meta products and platforms, or visit third-party websites and apps that integrate Meta Products, such as the “like” or “share” buttons.\\\\n\\\\nImportantly, these tracking technologies can collect data from a person even if they aren’t logged into a Facebook account or don’t have a Facebook account at all (except for users in the European Region).\\\\n\\\\nWhen your business adds Meta Business Tools to your website, app, or online store, Meta can set and read cookies. Meta can then collect information about any visitor, not just Facebook users.\\\\n\\\\nThat means Meta builds advertising and analytics profiles using data from both its users and individuals who don’t use its platforms.\\\\n\\\\nMeta maintains a separate cookies policy that outlines its use of these tracking technologies. If your business receives traffic from visitors in regions with explicit consent requirements — which is an ever-increasing percentage of the world — it’s particularly important to review Meta’s cookies policy carefully.\\\\n\\\\nYou’ll need to implement consent mechanisms that meet legal standards and update your own privacy notices to reflect Meta’s tracking activities on your site.\\\\n\\\\nUnsure about what type of consent you need? Learn the differences between opt-in and opt-out consent and which type you need under different global privacy laws.\\\\n\\\\n### Who does Meta share personal data with?\\\\n\\\\nMeta shares personal data with some third parties for a variety of purposes.\\\\n\\\\nWhile the company states it doesn’t sell personal information, this kind of sharing can legally qualify as a “sale” of personal information under laws like the CCPA/CPRA, even when no money is exchanged.\\\\n\\\\nThe third parties Meta shares data with include the following:\\\\n\\\\n- Advertisers: Businesses that advertise on Meta’s platforms\\\\n\\\\n- Commerce and service partners: Businesses that offer goods or services on Facebook or other Meta products and platforms, as well as any providers acting on their behalf (for example, a payment processor)\\\\n\\\\n- Vendors and service providers: Third-party services that Meta uses to promote its own products, conduct research and surveys, deliver customer service, facilitate payments, analyze product usage, and investigate suspicious activity, among other things\\\\n\\\\n- Academic and public interest researchers: External researchers who focus on topics like safety, technology, or social impact\\\\n\\\\nBoth the data shared and who it’s shared with may vary based on how your business uses Meta Business Tools and what privacy choices users make.\\\\n\\\\n### International data transfers\\\\n\\\\nMeta transfers personal data across borders as part of its global operations. This includes sending data to countries where:\\\\n\\\\n- It has infrastructure, such as the United States, Ireland, Denmark, and Sweden, among others\\\\n\\\\n- Meta products are available\\\\n\\\\n- Its partners, vendors, service providers, and other third parties are located\\\\n\\\\nTo carry out these international data transfers in compliance with applicable privacy laws, Meta relies on legal mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and adequacy decisions.\\\\n\\\\nFor data transfers from the EU to the US, Meta states that, as of September 7, 2023, it relies on the EU-US Data Privacy Framework.\\\\n\\\\n### Sensitive information restrictions\\\\n\\\\nMeta prohibits businesses and partners from sharing certain types of sensitive information through its platform and tools.\\\\n\\\\nThis information includes, but is not limited to:\\\\n\\\\n- Health or medical data\\\\n\\\\n- Detailed financial data\\\\n\\\\n- Government ID numbers\\\\n\\\\n- GPS location data\\\\n\\\\n- Social Security numbers or local equivalents\\\\n\\\\n- Passwords\\\\n\\\\n- Any information that the sharer knows — or reasonably should know — is from or about a child under the age of 13\\\\n\\\\nIf Meta determines that a business may be violating these terms, it reserves the right to take action against that business.\\\\n\\\\n## How to align your business with privacy laws and Facebook privacy requirements\\\\n\\\\nWhile understanding Meta’s data practices is important, you must also be aware of your business’s direct responsibilities when handling user data in connection with Facebook, Meta Business Tools, and Meta products.\\\\n\\\\nBelow are the primary obligations you need to follow.\\\\n\\\\n### Meet EU consent standards under the GDPR and the DMA\\\\n\\\\nIf your business operates in the EU or targets users there, the Digital Markets Act (DMA) also requires Meta to obtain explicit user consent before combining personal data collected on your website with account information from Facebook or other Meta platforms for analytics or targeting.\\\\n\\\\nTo stay compliant, your consent banner or consent management platform (CMP) must clearly inform users of this data use and enable them to opt in.\\\\n\\\\nMonitor Facebook’s updates in the EU to make sure your consent collection practices align with both Facebook’s expectations and DMA requirements.\\\\n\\\\n### Follow data minimization principles\\\\n\\\\nWhen collecting personal data, practice data minimization by gathering only what you need. This helps you to comply with the GDPR and avoid sharing data that may be prohibited or unnecessary for your stated purpose.\\\\n\\\\n### Understand US opt-out requirements\\\\n\\\\nUS states that have implemented data privacy laws to date use an opt-out consent model. In most cases, prior consent for data collection and processing is not required, including for profiling or advertising. It is only necessary to enable users to opt out.\\\\n\\\\nMeta provides a Limited Data Use (LDU) parameter to help businesses comply. When enabled, Meta will limit how it processes the user’s data in line with the applicable state law, if that user had opted out.\\\\n\\\\nThe CCPA/CPRA includes an additional obligation that provides California residents the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal data for profiling or targeted advertising. Businesses must honor this right by prominently displaying a “Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Information” button or link.\\\\n\\\\nMany businesses choose to add this to their cookie banner, website footer, or app menu. You must also immediately stop sharing users’ data with Meta or other third parties when they exercise their right to opt out.\\\\n\\\\n### Follow purpose limitation principles\\\\n\\\\n### Protect the data you handle\\\\n\\\\nYour business is responsible for protecting any personal data it collects, processes, or shares, even after it has been shared with Meta. Data privacy laws like the GDPR and the CCPA/CPRA require businesses to implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to safeguard personal information.\\\\n\\\\nThese security obligations apply across the full data lifecycle — from collection to sharing. Any data processing agreement (DPA) you enter into with Meta should require Meta to apply the same security standards you use as a data controller.\\\\n\\\\nIf your business receives personal data from Meta, you’re responsible for protecting it just as you would any data you collect directly from users.\\\\n\\\\n### Be transparent with your users\\\\n\\\\nBelow is a non-exhaustive checklist of information the policy must include regarding your relationship with Meta.\\\\n\\\\n- Explain that you use Meta Business Tools, such as Facebook Pixel or Conversions API.\\\\n\\\\n- State your reasons for collecting and sharing data with Meta. For example, it may be used for ad targeting, analytics, or campaign measurement.\\\\n\\\\n- Disclose your use of Meta-related cookies and how users can manage or reject them through your site.\\\\n\\\\n- Inform users that data shared with Meta may be further shared by Meta, including with its partners or vendors.\\\\n\\\\n- Include links to Meta’s privacy and cookies policies.\\\\n\\\\n- Explain users’ rights under relevant laws and how they can exercise them, such as the right to object (under the GDPR) and the right to opt out (under the CCPA/CPRA).\\\\n\\\\n- If you use Meta ads for behavioral targeting, provide California users the option to opt out through a “Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Information” link.\\\\n\\\\n- If you rely on Facebook Page Insights, EU regulators treat you and Meta as joint data controllers. You should include a link to Facebook’s Page Controller Addendum and document this arrangement in your records of processing activities.\\\\n\\\\nMeta also requires that when you collect information from people who interact with your page, group, or event, you must first provide them with clear notice. Users must explicitly consent to your use of their data, and you must clearly explain that you, not Meta, are collecting and processing this information.\\\\n\\\\n### Take additional precautions when handling minors’ data\\\\n\\\\nMeta limits ad targeting for users under 18 to age and location only. Your business cannot circumvent these restrictions. For example, you must not use custom audiences based on lists known to include minors.\\\\n\\\\nIf your website or app is likely to attract minors, or if you collect data that could reasonably belong to users under 18, your business may be subject to heightened legal obligations. These requirements vary based on where your users are located and the nature of the data collected.\\\\n\\\\nThey include:\\\\n\\\\n- Obtaining verifiable parental consent under laws like the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the US, which must be separately obtained for collecting data and for sharing data\\\\n\\\\n- Obtaining explicit consent from a parent or legal guardian for minors under the age of 16, per GDPR requirements.

We always recommend engaging qualified legal counsel or privacy specialists regarding data privacy and protection issues and operations.\\\\n\\\\n## Frequently asked questions\\\\n\\\\n### What data does Facebook collect?\\\\n\\\\nFacebook collects personal data that falls into several categories:\\\\n\\\\n- User-provided information, such as email, age, phone number, profile photo, and payment and delivery data\\\\n\\\\n- User activity, such as posts, likes, shares, messages, and ad interactions\\\\n\\\\n- App, browser, and device data, such as device type, GPS, IP address, and signal strength\\\\n\\\\n- Data from businesses that use Meta tools like the Meta Pixel or Conversions API, which may include pages viewed, purchases, and in-app actions\\\\n\\\\n### Is Facebook GDPR-compliant?\\\\n\\\\nFacebook states that it complies with the GDPR and other privacy laws, but your business is still responsible for meeting legal requirements when collecting and sharing personal data.

We'll discuss this in more detail below.\\\\n\\\\n### Personal Information You Collect\\\\n\\\\nWhether you're running a physical store, an ecommerce store, or online services business, you'll need to collect basic personal information such as customers' names and contact details.\\\\n\\\\nHere's an example from Bando:\\\\n\\\\nIf you have a broader online presence extending beyond your Facebook Page, you'll also need to explain the other ways in which you collect personal information.\\\\n\\\\nHere's an example from Microsoft:\\\\n\\\\n### How You Use Personal Information\\\\n\\\\nYou must explain your purposes for collecting personal information, i.e. how you use it.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, you can use your Facebook Page to enable customers to book appointments or make orders. Or you might use Facebook Messenger to engage with customers and receive inquiries.\\\\n\\\\nYou should have a clear business purpose for using any personal information you collect. If you collect email addresses, names, and shipping addresses, you must explain why you do this.\\\\n\\\\nHere's an example from catering business Chrissie Cakes and Supplies:\\\\n\\\\n### How You Share Personal Information\\\\n\\\\nHere's an example from ecommerce business Jasmin Studio Crafts:\\\\n\\\\nNote that you don't necessarily need to name the businesses with whom you share personal information: you can just identify the types of businesses.\\\\n\\\\n## If You Have Customers In the UK or EU\\\\n\\\\nIf you've ever visited a company's Facebook Page from within the UK or the EU (or the wider European Economic Area), you might have noticed a link reading \\\\\\\"Information about Page Insights data.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nClicking this link leads to a page explaining that Facebook and Facebook Page Admins are \\\\\\\"joint controllers\\\\\\\" under the GDPR.\\\\n\\\\nA German court required Facebook to create this policy based on how its \\\\\\\"Insights\\\\\\\" product works. Here's where to find Insights:\\\\n\\\\nThe Insights tool automatically collects data about who visits your Page. As a Page Admin, you would never be able to actually use this data to determine whether a particular individual had visited your page.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, according to the EU, this data is personal information. And under the GDPR, you and Facebook are jointly responsible for processing it.\\\\n\\\\n### Your Obligations Under Facebook's Page Insights Controller Addendum\\\\n\\\\nAs a Facebook Page Admin, you're held jointly responsible for Insights data. Facebook's Page Insights Controller Addendum sets the rules about how you and Facebook should meet your legal obligations.\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR allows joint controllers to decide among themselves how they will fulfill their legal obligations. Fortunately, Facebook has allocated almost all of the GDPR's duties to itself, and there's not much left for Page Admins to do.\\\\n\\\\nHere are Page Admins' duties under the Addendum:\\\\n\\\\n- Your legal basis for processing Page Insights data and the \\\\\\\"legitimate interests\\\\\\\" you are pursuing by using this data\\\\n\\\\n- The identity of your responsible data controller and their contact details\\\\n\\\\n- The identity of your Data Protection Officer (if you have one)\\\\n\\\\nFacebook doesn't explain what any of this means or how you can communicate it to your customers. That's where we come in.\\\\n\\\\n### Your Legal Basis and Legitimate Interests\\\\n\\\\nFacebook requires you to identify your legal basis for processing Page Insights data.\\\\n\\\\nThe concept of the \\\\\\\"legal basis\\\\\\\" (or \\\\\\\"lawful basis\\\\\\\") is very important under the GDPR.\\\\n\\\\nWe won't go into detail about the legal bases here. Essentially, there are six legal bases, and every time you collect personal information, you need to identify a legal basis for doing so.\\\\n\\\\nSo, what's your legal basis for receiving personal information from Page Insights? Well, Facebook suggests that it might be in your \\\\\\\"legitimate interests,\\\\\\\" which is one of the six legal bases.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\"Legitimate interests\\\\\\\" can be a suitable legal basis when you process personal information in a way that benefits your business without causing any significant privacy risks. You should carry out a Legitimate Interests Assessment if you plan on relying on this legal basis.\\\\n\\\\nHere's an example of a clause that addresses this:\\\\n\\\\nThe clause explains how Insights works and then identifies its legitimate interests in receiving Insights data: the ability to recognize user preferences and locations and to adapt and improve its offer accordingly.\\\\n\\\\n### Responsible Data Controller and Data Protection Officer\\\\n\\\\nFacebook requires that you provide a name and contact details for the \\\\\\\"responsible data controller.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe responsible data controller is your company. Your company is a data controller under the GDPR because it decides why and how to process personal information.\\\\n\\\\nFacebook also requires that you provide contact details for your Data Protection Officer. However, unless your business has over 250 employees, or it regularly processes sensitive personal information, it's unlikely you'll need to appoint a Data Protection Officer.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, go to your Facebook Page dashboard and select \\\\\\\"Edit Page Info\\\\\\\" in the top right-hand corner.\\\\n\\\\n## Summary\\\\n\\\\n- Who you are, and how your customers can contact you\\\\n\\\\n- What personal information you collect\\\\n\\\\n- How you use personal information\\\\n\\\\n- How you share personal information\\\\n\\\\nIf you have customers in the UK or EU, you also need to comply with Facebook's Page Insights Joint Controller Addendum.\\\\n\\\\nStay compliant with our agreements, policies, and consent banners — everything you need, all in one place.\\\\n\\\\nDisclaimer\\\\n\\\\nThis article is not a substitute for professional legal advice.

writer) and last updated on 01 July 2022.\\\\n\\\\nIf you operate a Facebook Page, both you and Facebook may need to follow the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Facebook has specific rules on how it splits GDPR responsibilities with Page administrators.\\\\n\\\\n- 1. GDPR Basics\\\\n\\\\n- 2. GDPR Controllers and Processors\\\\n\\\\n- 3. Facebook Page Insights and Personal Data\\\\n\\\\n- 4. Page Insights Controller Addendum\\\\n\\\\n- 5.1. Facebook Requirements\\\\n\\\\n- 5.1.1. Legal Basis\\\\n\\\\n- 5.1.2. Joint Controller Statement\\\\n\\\\n- 5.2. GDPR Requirements\\\\n\\\\n- 8. Summary\\\\n\\\\n## GDPR Basics\\\\n\\\\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Union regulation, meaning it has legal effect in every country that's a member of the EU.\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR applies to any personal data processing if:\\\\n\\\\n- The business that processes the data (or decides how it's processed) is in an EU country\\\\n\\\\n- The data subject (the person the data is about) is in an EU country, or\\\\n\\\\n- The data processing physically takes place in an EU country\\\\n\\\\n(Note that although the United Kingdom is no longer an EU country, it is currently scheduled to follow EU Regulations until the end of 2020. After that the same measures will still apply in the UK through domestic law until this law is revoked, amended or replaced.)\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR sets out a wide range of rules about personal data processing. The fundamentals are that:\\\\n\\\\n- It's only legal to process personal data in a limited range of circumstances, most commonly that the data subject has given meaningful consent or the processing is necessary for your legitimate interests.\\\\n\\\\n- Processing means any use of data, including collection and disclosure.\\\\n\\\\n- You must tell the data subject, in advance, the purpose or purposes for which you will process data.\\\\n\\\\n- You must inform the data subject again (and get fresh consent if appropriate) before processing the data for a new purpose.\\\\n\\\\n- The data subject has the right to know what data you store about them and whether you've disclosed it to a third party. They also have the right to correct errors and, in some circumstances, ask you to delete data.\\\\n\\\\n- You must adequately secure the data.\\\\n\\\\n## GDPR Controllers and Processors\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR holds two groups responsible for data processing.\\\\n\\\\n- Controllers decide what data is collected and how it is processed. They may also carry out the processing.\\\\n\\\\n- Processors carry out processing following the instructions of controllers.\\\\n\\\\nIn simple terms, both controllers and processors are responsible for complying with the GDPR, while controllers are also responsible for making sure processors working for them are complying with the GDPR.\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR also allows for the situation where two different controllers make decisions about processing the same data. As long as the same data is processed for the same purpose, the two are considered joint controllers.\\\\n\\\\nThis has important legal consequences. Ultimately both joint controllers are individually responsible for all the processing and could be individually responsible for paying compensation after a breach. However, the GDPR does allow the joint controllers to set out who will be in charge of complying with which specific GDPR requirements. This includes who will take responsibility for dealing with any complaints or any communication with regulators (known under the GDPR as supervisory authorities).\\\\n\\\\n## Facebook Page Insights and Personal Data\\\\n\\\\nFor the most part the data processing and GDPR situation with Facebook is simple. When individuals post on their own account or in groups, it is Facebook that is collecting and processing data and thus Facebook that is classed as the controller whenever that processing comes under the GDPR.\\\\n\\\\nThe situation is more complicated with Pages. These work in a similar way to a personal profile but cover an organization, business or brand. Rather than users becoming \\\\\\\"friends,\\\\\\\" users choose to \\\\\\\"like\\\\\\\" a page and can then see updates from it. Each Page is set up by a Facebook user who then acts as its administrator.\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR element comes into play because the administrator is able to access information about people who interact with the page. This information comes through a service called Page Insights which uses cookies to collect data about page interactions and users.\\\\n\\\\nThat created a legal argument that the Page administrator could be classed as a data controller because their decision to create the Page contributed to data being collected and processed.\\\\n\\\\nAs Facebook is also clearly a data controller in this context, it's down to Facebook and the Page administrator to determine whether they have joint controller status and how this will operate.\\\\n\\\\n## Page Insights Controller Addendum\\\\n\\\\nThe joint controller set-up is covered by the Page Insights Controller Addendum, which is part of Facebook's Pages, Groups and Events Policies. By creating a Page, you agree to this addendum and its position on joint controllers. In this context, \\\\\\\"Facebook\\\\\\\" means Facebook Ireland Limited.\\\\n\\\\nThe key points are as follows:\\\\n\\\\n- Facebook and the Page administrator are joint controllers in the case of data collected through Page events (that is, interactions with the Page) and then aggregated to provide it to the administrator through Page Insights.\\\\n\\\\n- The Page administrator is responsible for having a legal basis to process Insights Data.\\\\n\\\\n- Facebook is responsible for most other aspects of GDPR compliance, specifically: Facebook's own legal basis for processing data Informing data subjects about the collection and processing Handling the data subject's rights such as access, correction and deletion Making any notifications after a data breach\\\\n\\\\n- Facebook's own legal basis for processing data\\\\n\\\\n- Informing data subjects about the collection and processing\\\\n\\\\n- Handling the data subject's rights such as access, correction and deletion\\\\n\\\\n- Making any notifications after a data breach\\\\n\\\\nFacebook decides how to comply with its GDPR obligations.\\\\n\\\\nIf a Page Administrator receives a data access request regarding Page Insights data, they must not respond. Instead they must pass the request on to Facebook within seven days using this form:\\\\n\\\\n### Facebook Requirements\\\\n\\\\n#### Legal Basis\\\\n\\\\nFacebook requires you to tell users what your legal basis is for the collection and processing of data through Page Insights. (Remember that you are jointly responsible for such processing.)\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR sets out six allowable legal bases in Article 6:\\\\n\\\\n- Consent\\\\n\\\\n- Processing necessary to perform a contract\\\\n\\\\n- Processing necessary to comply with a legal obligation\\\\n\\\\n- Processing necessary to protect someone's vital interests\\\\n\\\\n- Processing necessary to carry out a task in the public interest or to exercise official authority\\\\n\\\\n- Processing necessary for the controller's legitimate interests\\\\n\\\\nPage visitors don't get enough information or give specific meaningful consent to make basis 1 suitable in most cases involving Page Insights. Bases 2 through 5 will rarely if ever apply to Page Insights.\\\\n\\\\nThis leaves basis 6, legitimate interests. For this basis to apply, you must go through a three point checklist:\\\\n\\\\n- What exactly is the legitimate interest?\\\\n\\\\n- Is the processing necessary to achieve this interest?\\\\n\\\\n- Do the individual's personal data rights and freedoms override this interest?\\\\n\\\\nNormally your access to Page Insights should meet these tests and thus legitimate interests is an acceptable legal basis.\\\\n\\\\nUsing Page Insights helps you learn more about your audience and thus improve and target the service and information you provide. The fact you can only access the information in aggregated form means it doesn't pose a serious risk or breach of privacy for an individual.\\\\n\\\\nRomantic Germany goes beyond simply stating it relies on \\\\\\\"legitimate interests\\\\\\\" and instead explains to users what this means:\\\\n\\\\n#### Joint Controller Statement\\\\n\\\\nLufthansa does this in a policy dedicated to its Facebook Page:\\\\n\\\\nBASF gives additional detail on what data is processed through Page Insights, listing specifics like your country of location, number of visits, gender relations, etc.:\\\\n\\\\n### GDPR Requirements\\\\n\\\\n- Your identity and contact details that of your data protection officer (if you have one)\\\\n\\\\n- What data you process\\\\n\\\\n- The purpose for processing\\\\n\\\\n- The legal basis for processing\\\\n\\\\n- How long you'll keep the data\\\\n\\\\n- Whether you share the data with anyone else\\\\n\\\\n- The user's rights to access data, correct it, and ask you to delete it\\\\n\\\\nGood Game Studios puts this information directly after the details of the Page Insights data processing:\\\\n\\\\n- Answer a few questions about your business:\\\\n\\\\n- Enter the country and click on the \\\\\\\"Next Step\\\\\\\" button:\\\\n\\\\nThe second is to make sure your identity and contact details are clearly listed in the About section of your Page. To avoid confusion, do so through the standard About field rather than posting it elsewhere on the Page, for example as a pinned post:\\\\n\\\\n## Summary\\\\n\\\\nLet's recap what you need to know and do to comply with the joint controller rules for Facebook Page Insights:\\\\n\\\\n- The GDPR applies if a data controller, a data subject, or the processing itself is in an EU country.\\\\n\\\\n- When the GDPR applies, the data controller must give the data subject details of what data is processed, how and why. They must have a legal basis to process the data.\\\\n\\\\n- A data controller is the person or organization that decides what data to process and how to do so. The GDPR allows for joint controllers of particular data. They share legal responsibility but can divide compliance tasks between them.\\\\n\\\\n- Facebook collects data about interactions with Pages and makes this data available to Page administrators through the Page Insight program.\\\\n\\\\n- Facebook's terms - which Page administrators must agree to - say that Facebook and the Page administrator are joint controllers for the Page Insight data.\\\\n\\\\n- Facebook agrees to handle most of the GDPR compliance tasks relating to the Page Insight data. It requires the Page administrator to take responsibility for having a legal basis for the data's processing. In most cases this will be \\\\\\\"legitimate interests.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n- Page users can make data access requests to the Page administrator, but the Page administrator must pass this on to Facebook within seven days. Facebook will handle the request.\\\\n\\\\n- Add their full contact details\\\\n\\\\n### About this article\\\\n\\\\nLast updated\\\\n\\\\nThis article was last updated on 01 July 2022.\\\\n\\\\nAuthor\\\\n\\\\nJohn Lister\\\\n\\\\nFreePrivacyPolicy Legal writer\\\\n\\\\nCategory\\\\n\\\\nDisclaimer\\\\n\\\\nPlease note that legal information, including legal templates and legal policies, is not legal advice.\\\\n\\\\n### Try out our free generators\\\\n\\\\nFree Cookie Consent\\\\n\\\\nFree Terms and Conditions Generator\\\\n\\\\nFree Cookies Policy Generator\\\\n\\\\nFree Disclaimer Generator\\\\n\\\\nFree EULA Generator\\\\n\\\\nFree Return & Refund Policy Generator\\\\n\\\\n### What our customers says\\\\n\\\\n— Anonymous\\\\n\\\\n— Andrea - Toronto Success Coach\\\\n\\\\nQuick and easy way to secure our company website.

Instagram warns users to be careful about what they share and communicate through their personal content.\\\\n\\\\nTo further protect users, the company is changing how data generated on their sites and apps are kept and shared.\\\\n\\\\nInstagram has always had account settings that allow you to control who can see and access your profile. But previously, when you employed third-party apps such as a web-based program to view your Instagram feed, you may have unwittingly agreed to make your photo content visible in search engines. Ad data shared with partners has demographic details in it, but it does not have personally identifying details.\\\\n\\\\nIf you choose to delete your Instagram account, your posts will vanish, but data shared by others isn’t considered part of your account.

There's lots of information in our Data Policy about the kinds of information we collect, with some examples and links to where you can learn more. But here are some of the categories of things we receive: the content you provide when you post, like or comment, your connections, your transactions, and your usage of our products. We also collect information that other people provide about you, like when they tag you in a photo. We also collect information from your device, such as identifiers, cookies, and information you can control using your device settings, including your camera, microphone and different kinds of location information, along with information from our partners, like websites you visit, apps you use or purchases you make.\\\\n\\\\nSharing Your Data\\\\n\\\\nData allows us to provide a personalized experience to different people, and to learn new things and improve our service. There's lots of information in our Data Policy about the ways we use the information we have, with some examples and links to where you can learn more. But here are some of the ways we use data:\\\\n\\\\n- People and accounts on Instagram, depending on the audience you choose, your settings, and the features you use. Remember that public information can be seen by anyone.\\\\n\\\\n- Services (like apps and websites) you choose to give access to your Instagram information, like if you use a service to see all your social media together. You can revoke their access to your information, here.\\\\n\\\\n- Advertisers. We help advertisers understand whether their ads are effective. We also share with companies that help to make reports for advertisers.\\\\n\\\\n- Companies that offer things through Instagram, like if you buy something and provide your shipping address.\\\\n\\\\n- Vendors and service providers we hire to help us with our business.\\\\n\\\\n- Researchers and academics, like to try to understand how to stop bullying and harassment online.\\\\n\\\\n- Legal requests (like from a court or law enforcement), when consistent with the law and our policies.\\\\n\\\\nHow To Access and Download Your Data\\\\n\\\\nA great first step to controlling your online data is to understand what you’ve shared. We offer tools to review the information we have for your account and the data you’ve shared on Instagram. You’ll see information we have about you, as well as your content, like your posts, comments, and messages. Learn how to use these tools in our Help Center.\\\\n\\\\nHow to Delete Your Data\\\\n\\\\nSometimes people change their minds about things they’ve shared online. To delete a photo or video that you've posted, tap above your post and then tap Delete. You can also archive posts to hide them from your profile and make it so your followers and other people on Instagram can't see it. But don’t worry—when you archive a post, it keeps all its likes and comments.\\\\n\\\\nYou can also temporarily disable or delete your account at any time. When you delete your account, we delete your posts, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Learn more.\\\\n\\\\nAnything that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted if you delete your account. But, if you are concerned about a picture or information someone else has posted about you, you can report it to us.

It stipulates that all tech providers will use data solely for the specific purpose outlined by the client.\\\\n\\\\nTech providers are also subject to rules regarding client information, data sharing with clients, and client termination.\\\\n\\\\n### Prohibited Practices Regarding Data Use\\\\n\\\\nSome of the prohibited uses include:\\\\n\\\\n- Processing platform data to discriminate or encourage discrimination against others\\\\n\\\\n- Processing platform data to make eligibility determinations about people (like housing, employment, or education opportunities)\\\\n\\\\n- Processing platform data to perform or facilitate surveillance\\\\n\\\\n- Selling, licensing, or purchasing the data\\\\n\\\\n- Placing the data on a search engine or making it otherwise available\\\\n\\\\n- Decoding, circumventing, re-identifying, de-anonymising, or unscrambling the data in any way\\\\n\\\\n- Changing the functionality of your app or data processing so users view it as an unfamiliar or different app\\\\n\\\\n- Processing friends list from Facebook (also owned by Meta) to establish social connections in your platform, unless each person grants you access for that purpose\\\\n\\\\nTheir policy outlines additional restrictions regarding who you share the data with and your data retention, deletion, and accessibility options for consumers granted those rights by data privacy laws and regulations.\\\\n\\\\nThese laws impact businesses worldwide, and some have very broad thresholds, so chances are at least one applies to your business.\\\\n\\\\nWhile each piece of legislation is different, you’ll need to include the following information:\\\\n\\\\n- What personal data you collect\\\\n\\\\n- Why you collect the information\\\\n\\\\n- How you use it (aka, your legal basis)\\\\n\\\\n- Who you share it with or sell it to\\\\n\\\\n- What rights your users have over that data\\\\n\\\\n- How they can follow through on those rights\\\\n\\\\n- California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which amends some areas of the CCPA\\\\n\\\\n- California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)\\\\n\\\\n- Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA)\\\\n\\\\n- Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)\\\\n\\\\n#### Introduction\\\\n\\\\nIn this section, you introduce your business, explain who the terms of the policy apply to, and write clear definitions of phrases used throughout the agreement so your users’ expectations are properly set.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, this is where you would want to include your business’s physical address and even its complete legal entity name(s).\\\\n\\\\nSee an image of their introductory clause below.\\\\n\\\\n#### What Personal Data You Collect\\\\n\\\\nIn this section, list the categories of personal data you collect and process about your users, including any sensitive personal information.\\\\n\\\\nBe thorough and specific in this section to meet the Instagram Platform Terms and any additional legal requirements.\\\\n\\\\nAdobe has an excellent example of this clause, shown in the screenshot below.\\\\n\\\\n#### Why You Collect the Data and How it Gets Used\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re subject to laws like the GDPR or the CCPA, you must say why you collect the data and include your legal basis.\\\\n\\\\n#### Who You Share the Data With\\\\n\\\\nThis way, your users can read those third-party agreements and decide if they’re comfortable giving those entities access to their information.\\\\n\\\\nBelow, see how Adobe formats this clause in their privacy agreement.\\\\n\\\\n#### Internet Cookies\\\\n\\\\nUnder laws like the GDPR and CCPA, internet cookies qualify as personal data, plus most of these regulations give users the right to limit how their information gets used regarding analytics and advertising.\\\\n\\\\nAdobe includes a short paragraph with live links to their other policies, shown below.\\\\n\\\\n#### The Legal Rights of Your Consumers\\\\n\\\\nYou must list all rights your users have over their data if you’re subject to laws like the GDPR, CCPA, or the Virginia CDPA.\\\\n\\\\nYou can do this in one clause or separate it into policies specific to users in those unique areas.\\\\n\\\\n#### Information Regarding Children’s Data\\\\n\\\\nIf your services target children, you must follow additional requirements to process their information, like obtaining consent from their legal guardians.\\\\n\\\\n#### International Data Transfers\\\\n\\\\nThe GDPR outlines specific guidelines regarding international data transfers.\\\\n\\\\nSome countries are approved for transfers because they follow the same safety standards mandated by the regulation.\\\\n\\\\nBut if you transfer to other places, including the US, you must ensure the third party signs an agreement stating they’ll abide by all the obligations, user rights, and data protocols required by the GDPR.\\\\n\\\\nBelow, read how Adobe phrases this clause in its policy.\\\\n\\\\n#### Safety and Security\\\\n\\\\nAdobe puts a short paragraph in its policy to meet this legal requirement, as shown below.\\\\n\\\\n- Use a managed solution\\\\n\\\\n- Try a free template\\\\n\\\\n- Do it yourself\\\\n\\\\nLet’s walk through these solutions so you can choose what’s best for you.\\\\n\\\\n### Managed Solution\\\\n\\\\nTo use it, you answer questions about your business, and it kicks out a compliant, properly formatted agreement that you can then link to your website or app.\\\\n\\\\nTermly’s product engineers and data privacy experts help ensure that all of the tools reflect the most recent data privacy laws and regulations, which often change.\\\\n\\\\nSee a screenshot of our generator below.\\\\n\\\\n### Free Template\\\\n\\\\nThese take more work on your end, as you’ll have to fill out blank sections of the agreement manually. But they still provide proper formatting, the most common clauses, and standardized language that typically appears in these legal policies.\\\\n\\\\nI recommend using a template if you don’t actually collect data from your users or if your data processing is minimal.\\\\n\\\\nBelow, you can see a screenshot of our free template.\\\\n\\\\n### Do-It-Yourself\\\\n\\\\n- Make your policy clear and freely accessible. People can’t be charged to access it.\\\\n\\\\n- Clearly define compliance rules, like age and content restrictions.\\\\n\\\\n- Clearly define what information you’ll access and how you’ll use it.\\\\n\\\\n- Explain how you’ll utilize user-generated content.\\\\n\\\\n- Tell users how you protect their data and what security measures are in place.\\\\n\\\\n- Include information on international privacy laws, like the GDPR and CCPA.\\\\n\\\\n- In the settings field in your App Dashboard\\\\n\\\\n- In the official listing of your app on any App Stores that allow you to do so\\\\n\\\\nBut for legal compliance under laws like the GDPR and CCPA, you should put a link to your agreement at or before the point of data collection.\\\\n\\\\nIt should also live in a static place on your website, like in the footer or within a specific privacy center, so consumers can easily find and read it.\\\\n\\\\nYou can manually add one of these pages to your own website. Or, if you use Termly, we’ll provide the URL for you. Either option works for both Instagram and legal compliance.\\\\n\\\\nBut by enforceable, I really mean compliant. Privacy policies are descriptions of your privacy collection practices intended to inform your users; it’s not a set of rules or directions your users must follow.\\\\n\\\\n- Ask them to select an unmarked checkbox to express that they’ve read and agreed to it\\\\n\\\\nThis second method is known as the browsewrap method or implied consent.\\\\n\\\\n## Summary\\\\n\\\\nInstagram privacy policies are required for any app or website that uses their API, even those that don’t collect personal data.\\\\n\\\\nThese policies must cover a variety of requirements, including what’s included in Meta’s Platform Terms and any laws or regulations that impact your business.\\\\n\\\\n##### More about the author\\\\n\\\\n#### Written by Stefani Schmidt, M.S., CIPM, CIPP-US\\\\n\\\\n- Termly vs Ketch: Comparing Features and Services Comparisons November 14, 2025Ali Talip Pınarbaşı, CIPP/E, & LLM\\\\n\\\\n##### Termly vs Ketch: Comparing Features and Services\\\\n\\\\nNovember 14, 2025Ali Talip Pınarbaşı, CIPP/E, & LLM\\\\n\\\\nNovember 7, 2025Hanna De La Garza\\\\n\\\\n- 5 Types of Legal Requirements for Ecommerce Stores Articles November 5, 2025Natasha Piirainen\\\\n\\\\n##### 5 Types of Legal Requirements for Ecommerce Stores\\\\n\\\\nNovember 5, 2025Natasha Piirainen\\\\n\\\\n- 14 Website Policies You Need and How To Make Them Articles October 15, 2025Hanna De La Garza\\\\n\\\\n##### 14 Website Policies You Need and How To Make Them\\\\n\\\\nOctober 15, 2025Hanna De La Garza\\\\n\\\\nOctober 15, 2025Natasha Piirainen\\\\n\\\\n- 5 Best GDPR WordPress Plugins for GDPR Compliance Articles October 15, 2025Natasha Piirainen\\\\n\\\\n##### 5 Best GDPR WordPress Plugins for GDPR Compliance\\\\n\\\\n- Clickwrap vs. Browsewrap Agreements and When To Use Them Articles October 15, 2025Natasha Piirainen\\\\n\\\\n##### Clickwrap vs. Browsewrap Agreements and When To Use Them\\\\n\\\\n- Do Not Track Disclosures Articles October 15, 2025Natasha Piirainen\\\\n\\\\n##### Do Not Track Disclosures\\\\n\\\\nExplore more resources\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Their policy outlines additional restrictions regarding who you share the data with and your data retention, deletion, and accessibility options for consumers granted those rights by data privacy laws and regulations.

Every photo. Every voice message. Fed into AI,\\\\\\\" the post read.\\\\n\\\\nThe claim was also spread on [Threads](https://www.threads.com/@hustlewithchip/post/DQscX-SAQJc) ([archived](https://archive.ph/PpDTq)) and prompted Snopes readers to search the site for the truth of it.\\\\n\\\\nMeta's planned privacy policy update on Dec. 16, 2025, does not pertain to direct messages and does not change how Meta handles them, though. The update instead will focus on how it uses data collected from conversations people have with Meta AI, the company's generative artificial intelligence (AI) app. We therefore rate this claim as false.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\"The update mentioned in the viral rumor isn't about DMs at all, it's about how we'll use people's interactions with our AI features to further personalize their experience,\\\\\\\" a Meta spokesperson told Snopes over email. \\\\\\\"We do not use the content of your private messages with friends and family to train our AIs unless you or someone in the chat chooses to share those messages with our AIs. This also isn't new, nor is it part of this Dec. 16 privacy policy update.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nOn Oct. 1, 2025, [Meta revealed](https://about.fb.com/news/2025/10/improving-your-recommendations-apps-ai-meta/) that it planned to update its privacy policy on Dec. 16. The incoming major change to the company's privacy policy, according to the news release, was that Meta would start using peoples' interactions with its generative AI features to personalize content and ad recommendations.\\\\n\\\\nFollowing the announcement, Meta kept both its [current privacy policy](https://archive.ph/nLWj7), last updated in June 2025, and its [upcoming privacy policy](https://archive.ph/BDgxu#1) on its website.\\\\n\\\\nIn both [current](https://archive.ph/nLWj7#selection-479.0-483.39:~:text=Messages%20you%20send%20and%20receive%2C%20including%20their%20content%2C%20subject%20to%20applicable%20law.%20On%20some%20Products%2C%20you%20can%20use%20end%2Dto%2Dend%20encrypted%20messages.%20Learn%20more%20about%20how%20end%2Dto%2Dend%20encryption%20works.) and [new](https://archive.ph/BDgxu#selection-475.0-479.39:~:text=Messages%20that%20you%20send%20and%20receive%2C%20including%20their%20content%2C%20subject%20to%20applicable%20law.%20On%20some%20Products%2C%20you%20can%20use%20end%2Dto%2Dend%20encrypted%20messages.%20Learn%20more%20about%20how%20end%2Dto%2Dend%20encryption%20works.) privacy policies, the section on that data Meta collects included the same passage about messages:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\"Messages that you send and receive, including their content, subject to applicable law. On some Products, you can use end-to-end encrypted messages.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAccording to [Meta's policies](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/1084673321594605), end-to-end encrypted messages cannot be read by Meta: \\\\\\\"End-to-end encrypted messages and calls ensure only you and the people you're communicating with can see or listen to what is sent, and no one else, not even Meta, can do so.\\\\\\\" Despite this policy, people can choose to [store encrypted messages remotely with Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/820525008940780) and Meta may read encrypted messages if one of the people in the conversation [reports a message](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/498828660322839?cms_platform=android-app&helpref=platform_switcher). When someone reports an encrypted message, recent messages from that conversation are forwarded and sent to Meta for review, according to the company's policies.\\\\n\\\\nAt the time Meta launched default encrypted messages on Messenger in December 2023, the company [wrote](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/12/default-end-to-end-encryption-on-messenger/#:~:text=nobody%2C%20including%20Meta%2C%20can%20see%20what%E2%80%99s%20sent%20or%20said%2C%20unless%20you%20choose%20to%20report%20a%20message), \\\\\\\"nobody, including Meta, can see what's sent or said, unless you choose to report a message.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nNot all messaging systems on Meta's platforms are encrypted. While Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp conversations are set to be encrypted by default, chats with Facebook groups, chats with businesses and Marketplace chats are [not encrypted](https://archive.ph/ulJzQ). According to Meta policy, the company may collect that data.\\\\n\\\\n#### Sources\\\\n\\\\nCrisan, Loredana. \\\\\\\"Launching Default End-To-End Encryption on Messenger.\\\\\\\" Meta, 7 Dec. 2023, about.fb.com/news/2023/12/default-end-to-end-encryption-on-messenger/.

Usually, they’re incredibly difficult to read. Research, [polling](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/), [reporting](https://themarkup.org/the-breakdown/2023/08/03/how-to-quickly-get-to-the-important-truth-inside-any-privacy-policy), and personal experiences [abound](https://iacis.org/iis/2022/2_iis_2022_138-149.pdf) on why privacy policies are so [bad](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/05/31/abolish-privacy-policies/) these days: [they are too long](https://lorrie.cranor.org/pubs/readingPolicyCost-authorDraft.pdf), [use legalistic and inaccessible terminology](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/12/opinion/facebook-google-privacy-policies.html), [are presented as take-it-or-leave-it](https://kb.osu.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/ff3341dc-dd6f-5fdf-920c-245521837c05/content), and [much more](https://kb.osu.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/d6692cd5-a08e-534e-9350-735fb279bce4/content). None of this is new information (although, it’s all still a serious and widespread problem).\\\\n\\\\nBut less attention is often paid to how privacy policies themselves are *displayed.*As someone who has spent a substantial amount of time reviewing these policies across countless companies and platforms, in my work researching commercial data practices, I’ve come to regard one company as perhaps the worst of the lot in how it visually presents its policies: Meta. Regulators and lawmakers should take note.\\\\n\\\\n## How did it get this way?\\\\n\\\\nThe 20-year-old, US-based multinational conglomerate founded by Mark Zuckerberg has [over three billion](https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2024/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2023-Results-Initiates-Quarterly-Dividend/default.aspx) daily active users worldwide and operates products and services ranging from Facebook and Instagram to WhatsApp, Oculus, and AI models such as Llama. Yet, understanding what the company is collecting, inferring, and purchasing, let alone doing with individuals’ data, is made even more challenging by the way Meta incomprehensibly lays out its privacy policy language.\\\\n\\\\nIt is, to say the least, a test to think of any company besides Meta that puts so much effort into breaking up its privacy policies into probably hundreds of indigestible pieces, scattered across numerous websites and pages, with confusing hyperlinks, circular references to documents, no ability to comprehensively and functionally search across documents, and misleading or inaccurate statements about what specific pages describe to the viewer. In other words: it’s a usability disaster.\\\\n\\\\nSearching “Meta privacy policy” online brings up a [page on Facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/) titled “What is the Privacy Policy and what does it cover?” It’s remarkably long. It’s broken up into many subsections. It’s difficult to search. It’s hard to navigate. And, at the time of this writing, that webpage alone had 168 links to various other webpages and pop-ups within the page.\\\\n\\\\nIf you click on just one of those, such as “[Review the privacy policies of the other Meta companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678),” it brings you to a page called “[The Meta Companies](https://web.archive.org/web/20241008070028/https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678)” which then links to terms for Meta Payments, Facebook Payments International, and more. When I clicked on the [EU privacy terms for Facebook Payments Limited International](https://web.archive.org/web/20240927014044/https://www.facebook.com/payments_terms/EU_privacy), it directed me to a page with no information on it that prompted me to log into a Facebook.com account. One page claims to tell you something useful and points to many other pages and popups, which also tell you you’ll get the information you want—if you just click one more hyperlink. It’s turtles all the way down.\\\\n\\\\nDesigning privacy information in this way makes it nearly impossible for the average user to understand what Meta does with respect to a specific product, service, or technology. Looking to learn what information is [collected and transmitted](https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/06/16/facebook-is-receiving-sensitive-medical-information-from-hospital-websites) via the Meta Pixel? If you’re hoping for a quick read, good luck. Meta breaks its Pixel documentation into numerous pages, and when you click on a link on the Pixel [Advanced Matching page](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel/advanced/advanced-matching) that claims to help you “learn what data is sent when using the Meta Pixel,” it directs you to the [general page](https://transparency.meta.com) for Meta’s Transparency Center. Now, we’re back where we started above, with numerous subsections and 168 links and pop-ups. Only by pulling together information from [many](https://web.archive.org/web/20241006044549/https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel/) [different](https://web.archive.org/web/20241003134755/https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel/implementation/conversion-tracking#custom-events) webpages is it possible for a user to even *see* all the information Meta posts about what data the Meta Pixel can transmit. (That’s before attempting to understand it.)\\\\n\\\\nTake another example. Maybe you’re concerned about Meta [saying](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/meta-will-start-collecting-anonymized-data-about-quest-headset-usage/) in February 2024 it would begin collecting what it called “anonymized” device usage data about Oculus headsets—at the same time as Meta [ended](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/4503393-meta-set-to-delete-all-oculus-account-data-by-end-of-march/) consumers’ ability to use an Oculus Quest headset without creating a Meta account or linking it to an existing one. Well, learning about that topic is a nightmare, too. The webpage for “[Legal Documents](https://web.archive.org/web/20240926134919/https://www.meta.com/legal/quest/)” about Quest devices links to dozens of different webpages, including a variety of “supplemental” policies and documents, that themselves have many links and subsections, again perpetuating the same design and layout problem. It would take hours just to pull together the information, before any work on consolidation and interpretation.\\\\n\\\\nMeta didn’t always display its privacy information this way. But over the years, the company (once eponymously known for its first product, Facebook) has presented its privacy policy in an [increasingly graphics-oriented format](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/13/facebook-updates-privacy-policy-data), riddled with drop-downs and buttons. The substance of that evolving set of privacy policies, as [pointed out](https://archive.epic.org/2014/12/facebook-revises-privacy-polic.html) by nonprofit groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center, has made clear the company has continued to collect and use individuals’ data without meaningful consent. Yet, the days when users could use a little CTRL+F or CMD+F magic to search for words within a page are in the rearview mirror. Meta’s design and display decisions have made answering basic questions—such as “what data does Meta gather via virtual reality headsets?” or “from which apps and services does Meta collect fine-grained geolocation data?”—virtually impossible for the average user. You can’t even attempt to understand what you can’t easily access in the first place. Given how much effort this confusing design must take, that might be Meta’s very objective.\\\\n\\\\n## It’s worse by comparison\\\\n\\\\nTo be very clear, Meta is hardly the only problematic actor when it comes to privacy policies. As described above, privacy policies are rife with length, complexity, and other issues. Many companies drown their privacy policies in words like “could,” “might,” or “may,” and while it might make for fun semantic debate in a law class, these hypotheticals don’t tell readers what companies are *actually doing* with data. They also intentionally leave the door open to companies doing anything they want with individuals’ data tomorrow or five years from now.\\\\n\\\\n#### Our Content delivered to your inbox.\\\\n\\\\nJoin our newsletter on issues and ideas at the intersection of tech & democracy\\\\n\\\\n#### Thank you!\\\\n\\\\nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list.\\\\n\\\\nThe privacy policy for Google, for example, is not the most accessible document in the world and [contains](https://iacis.org/iis/2022/2_iis_2022_138-149.pdf) many such hypothetical statements and privacy loopholes. It also has lots of vague language. But Meta stands out even from its data-hoarding competitors like Google and TikTok in just how badly it presents its “privacy policy” information—and just how difficult it is, should you have a specific question about a specific service or product, to find concrete information about what Meta does with your data.\\\\n\\\\n## Where are the regulators?\\\\n\\\\nAt a certain point, there should be consequences for designing the layout and presentation of privacy policies in completely unreasonably segmented, obfuscating ways. Perhaps it’s worth an inquiry into whether such practices violate the US [Federal Trade Commission Act](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/statutes/federal-trade-commission-act) and similar prohibitions on deceptive business practices. Legislators should prevent these bad practices in future privacy laws, too.\\\\n\\\\nThe FTC, for its part, has been clear in its [enforcement decisions](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/D%26O-InMarketMediaLLC.pdf) that companies should seek “affirmative express consent” from consumers before collecting and using their data. Doing so requires “clear and conspicuous disclosure” to consumers of the categories of data collected about them; the purposes of data collection, use, and disclosure; “a simple, descriptive URL (or hyperlink if technically possible) to a document that describes” this information; and “a simple, descriptive URL (or hyperlink if technically possible) to a simple, easily-located means by which the consumer can withdraw consent and that describes any limitations on the consumer’s ability to withdraw consent.” Otherwise, companies may be in violation of [Section 5 of the FTC Act](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/mission/enforcement-authority)—and its prohibition on unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\\\\n\\\\nMeta does not appear to clearly and conspicuously describe the data it collects about individuals. It does not have simple, descriptive URLs for these pages—in fact, any single privacy-related document on a Meta website could link to dozens or over 100 other pages and pop-ups that Meta purports provide additional information. Both of these points raise the question of whether Meta is deviating from practices the FTC has indicated are legally required.\\\\n\\\\nFurther, the FTC Act prevents deceptive practices in general—[defined](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/mission/enforcement-authority) by FTC [policy](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/410531/831014deceptionstmt.pdf) as “involving a material representation, omission, or practice that is likely to mislead a consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances.” If any number of pages on the Meta website that claim to provide consumers with information about privacy do not, in fact, provide and present said information in a reasonable manner (or, really, at all), it likewise raises the question of whether Meta might be violating the FTC Act by deceptively *designing* the layout of its privacy policy information.\\\\n\\\\nLawmakers working on privacy bills should not forget that substance *and* layout are important for privacy policies, to avoid these kinds of bad practices that bury information from consumers and regulators, further limit consumers’ ability to consent, and threaten individuals’ ability to exercise their privacy rights. New laws on privacy should require companies to make their privacy policies clearly laid out, on a single or just a few webpage(s), in an easily navigable and comprehensively searchable format. Regulators should also ask the question of whether certain kinds of presentations of privacy policies violate existing federal and state laws, introducing the need to investigate and potentially enforce compliance.\\\\n\\\\nWe’re long overdue for better laws, regulations, and technology practices for presenting data collection and use information to consumers. But in some cases, the design and presentation of privacy information is itself a serious problem—and Meta might just win the prize for “worst in show.”\\\\n\\\\n#### Related Reading\\\\n\\\\n- [Researchers Consider the Impact of Meta's CrowdTangle Shutdown](https://www.techpolicy.press/researchers-consider-the-impact-of-metas-crowdtangle-shutdown/) - [We Know a Little About Meta’s “Break Glass” Measures.

At Meta, we’ve always set out to build personalized experiences that provide value without compromising your privacy. So, it’s on us to have strong protections for the data we use and be transparent about how we use it. That includes communicating more clearly about our data practices and the choices you have.\\\\n\\\\nWe’re also including more ways to access controls you can use to experience our products in ways that are right for you. You can continue to manage your privacy settings at any time and we’re committed to letting you know if we make important changes to how we collect, use and share your information.\\\\n\\\\n## Responding To Feedback and Evolving Regulation\\\\n\\\\n## Privacy Center\\\\n\\\\nYou can think of Privacy Center as a hub for your privacy questions, where you can learn about how we use data, make use of some of the various privacy controls that we offer, and brush up on key account security tips and tools. We’ll also continue adding more guides and controls to it.\\\\n\\\\n## Updating Controls for Your Privacy\\\\n\\\\nNew Audience Controls: Starting today, we’re also rolling out a new setting to make it easier to manage who sees your posts on Facebook. Now, when someone selects a default audience, that audience selection will apply to new posts created in Facebook that they share to their timeline unless they select a different audience for a particular post. Previously, your default audience for posts matched whichever audience you chose most recently. So if you had just made a post that was available to the public, your subsequent posts would be as well. This new setting will help make sure you’re sharing with the right people in your community.\\\\n\\\\nNew Ways to Manage the Ads You See: Recently, we consolidated the Ad Topics and Interest Categories controls into a single control that can be accessed on Facebook and Instagram, covering a more extensive set of ad topics. This allows people to use a single control to set preferences across ad topics that reflect the interest targeting categories advertisers may use to reach them and the content they might see in an ad.\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"We’ve added more detailed explanations in our Privacy Policy including about how we use and share information with third parties. And we’ve paired it with the Privacy Center and new controls to manage your experience, like who sees your posts and the topics you want to see ads about.

We work with businesses that use Meta or third parties to help store and better manage their communications with you on WhatsApp.\\\\n\\\\n- Making It Easier To Connect. As part of the Meta Companies, WhatsApp partners with Meta to offer experiences and integrations across Meta’s family of apps and products.\\\\n\\\\n### Information We Collect\\\\n\\\\nWhatsApp must receive or collect some information to operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services, including when you install, access, or use our Services.\\\\n\\\\nThe types of information we receive and collect depend on how you use our Services. We require certain information to deliver our Services and without this we will not be able to provide our Services to you. For example, you must provide your mobile phone number to create an account to use our Services.\\\\n\\\\nOur Services have optional features which, if used by you, require us to collect additional information to provide such features. You will be notified of such collection, as appropriate. If you choose not to provide the information needed to use a feature, you will be unable to use the feature. For example, you cannot share your location with your contacts if you do not permit us to collect your location data from your device. Permissions can be managed through your Settings menu on both Android and iOS devices.\\\\n\\\\n#### Information You Provide\\\\n\\\\n- Your Account Information. You must provide your mobile phone number and basic information (including a profile name of your choice) to create a WhatsApp account.

You can add other information to your account, such as a profile picture and \\\\\\\"about\\\\\\\" information.\\\\n\\\\n- Your Messages. We do not retain your messages in the ordinary course of providing our Services to you. Instead, your messages are stored on your device and not typically stored on our servers. Once your messages are delivered, they are deleted from our servers. The following scenarios describe circumstances where we may store your messages in the course of delivering them: Undelivered Messages. If a message cannot be delivered immediately (for example, if the recipient is offline), we keep it in encrypted form on our servers for up to 30 days as we try to deliver it. If a message is still undelivered after 30 days, we delete it. Media Forwarding. When a user forwards media within a message, we store that media temporarily in encrypted form on our servers to aid in more efficient delivery of additional forwards.We offer end-to-end encryption for our Services. End-to-end encryption means that your messages are encrypted to protect against us and third parties from reading them.

There are certain settings relating to location-related information which you can find in your device settings or the in-app settings, such as location sharing. Even if you do not use our location-related features, we use IP addresses and other information like phone number area codes to estimate your general location (e.g., city and country).

For example, when other users you know use our Services, they may provide your phone number, name, and other information (like information from their mobile address book) just as you may provide theirs. They may also send you messages, send messages to groups to which you belong, or call you. We require each of these users to have lawful rights to collect, use, and share your information before providing any information to us. You should keep in mind that in general any user can capture screenshots of your chats or messages or make recordings of your calls with them and send them to WhatsApp or anyone else, or post them on another platform.\\\\n\\\\n- User Reports. Just as you can report other users, other users or third parties may also choose to report to us your interactions and your messages with them or others on our Services; for example, to report possible violations of our Terms or policies. When a report is made, we collect information on both the reporting user and reported user. To find out more about what happens when a user report is made, please see Advanced Safety and Security Features.\\\\n\\\\n- Third-Party Services. We allow you to use our Services in connection with third-party services and Meta Company Products. If you use our Services with such third-party services or Meta Company Products, we may receive information about you from them; for example, if you use the WhatsApp share button on a news service to share a news article with your WhatsApp contacts, groups, or broadcast lists on our Services, or if you choose to access our Services through a mobile carrier’s or device provider’s promotion of our Services. Please note that when you use third-party services or Meta Company Products, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those services and products.\\\\n\\\\n### How We Use Information\\\\n\\\\nWe use information we have (subject to choices you make and applicable law) to operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. Here's how:\\\\n\\\\n- Our Services.

We may provide you marketing for our Services and those of the Meta Companies.\\\\n\\\\n- No Third-Party Banner Ads. We still do not allow third-party banner ads on our Services. We have no intention to introduce them, but you may see other types of ads in the Updates Tab, home of features like Channels and Status.\\\\n\\\\n- Business Interactions. We enable you and third parties, like businesses, to communicate and interact with each other using our Services, such as Catalogs for businesses on WhatsApp through which you can browse products and services and place orders. Businesses may send you transaction, appointment, and shipping notifications; product and service updates; and marketing. For example, you may receive flight status information for upcoming travel, a receipt for something you purchased, or a notification when a delivery will be made. Messages you receive from a business could include an offer for something that might interest you. We do not want you to have a spammy experience; as with all of your messages, you can manage these communications, and we will honor the choices you make.\\\\n\\\\n### Information You And We Share\\\\n\\\\nYou share your information as you use and communicate through our Services, and we share your information to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services.\\\\n\\\\n- Send Your Information To Those With Whom You Choose To Communicate.

We work with these companies to support our Services, such as to provide technical infrastructure, delivery and other systems; market our Services; conduct surveys and research for us; protect the safety, security, and integrity of users and others; and assist with customer service. When we share information with third-party service providers and other Meta Companies in this capacity, we require them to use your information on our behalf in accordance with our instructions and terms.\\\\n\\\\n- Third-Party Services. When you or others use third-party services or other Meta Company Products that are integrated with our Services, those third-party services may receive information about what you or others share with them. For example, if you use a data backup service integrated with our Services (like iCloud or Google Account), they will receive information you share with them, such as your WhatsApp messages. If you interact with a third-party service or another Meta Company Product linked through our Services, such as when you use the in-app player to play content from a third-party platform, information about you, like your IP address and the fact that you are a WhatsApp user, may be provided to such third party or Meta Company Product. Please note that when you use third-party services or other Meta Company Products, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those services and products.\\\\n\\\\n### How We Work With Other Meta Companies\\\\n\\\\nAs part of the Meta Companies, WhatsApp receives information from, and shares information (see here) with, the other Meta Companies. We may use the information we receive from them, and they may use the information we share with them, to help operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services and their offerings, including the Meta Company Products.

Deleting your account will, for example, delete your account info and profile photo, delete you from all WhatsApp groups, and delete your WhatsApp message history. Be mindful that if you only delete WhatsApp from your device without using our in-app delete my account feature, your information will be stored with us for a longer period. Please remember that when you delete your account, it does not affect your information related to the groups you created or the information other users have relating to you, such as their copy of the messages you sent them.\\\\n\\\\nYou can learn more here about our data deletion and retention practices and about how to delete your account.\\\\n\\\\n### Law, Our Rights, And Protection\\\\n\\\\n### Our Global Operations\\\\n\\\\n### Updates To Our Policy\\\\n\\\\n### Privacy Rights for United States Residents\\\\n\\\\nYou can learn more about the consumer privacy rights that may be available to you, by reviewing the United States Regional Privacy Notice here.\\\\n\\\\nContact Us\\\",\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"This Privacy Policy applies to all of our Services unless specified otherwise.

We cannot see the contents of undelivered messages stored on our servers as they are encrypted. When a user sends media within a message, we store that media for up to 30 days in encrypted form on our servers to aid in more efficient delivery, such as if recipients choose to forward the media.

This includes collecting information about your activity (including how you use our Services), how you interact with others using our Services (including when you search for and interact with a business), and the time, frequency, and duration of your activities. This also includes information about the features you use like our messaging (and integrated applications), calling, Status, communities, groups or business features; whether you are online; timestamps related to your use such as when you last used our Services (your \\\\\\\"last seen\\\\\\\") and the times you send and receive calls and messages; and when you last updated your \\\\\\\"about\\\\\\\" information.\\\\n\\\\n- Log and Troubleshooting Information. We collect information about how our Services are performing when you use them, like service related diagnostic and performance information. This information includes log files, timestamps, diagnostic or crash data, website performance logs and error messages or reports.\\\\n\\\\n- Device And Connection Information.

For example, when other users you know use our Services, they may provide your phone number if they use contact upload just as you may provide theirs. We require each of these users to have lawful rights to collect, use, and share your information before providing any information to us. They may also send you messages, send messages to groups to which you belong, or call you.

Just as you can report other users, other users or third parties may also choose to report to us your interactions and your messages with them or others on our Services; for example, to report possible violations of our Terms or policies. When a report is submitted to us through the reporting tools, we receive information from the reporter on both the reporting user and those reported. To find out more about the information we receive when a User Report is submitted to us and what happens when a User Report is submitted, please see About blocking and reporting contacts.\\\\n\\\\n- Third-Party Services. WhatsApp receives information about bad actors and abuse from Meta Companies and app verification information from anti-abuse services to promote safety, security and integrity. For example, when Meta becomes aware of a scam encouraging individuals to contact a phone number via WhatsApp, they might share that phone number with WhatsApp so we can investigate the WhatsApp account. We also allow you to use our Services in connection with third-party services and Meta Company Products. If you use our Services with such third-party services or Meta Company Products, we may receive information about you from them; for example, if you use the WhatsApp share button on a news service to share a news article with your WhatsApp contacts, groups, or broadcast lists on our Services. Please note that when you use third-party services or Meta Company Products, the terms and privacy policies of the company that offers those services will govern your use of those services and products.\\\\n\\\\n### Information Shared by You and by WhatsApp with Third Parties\\\\n\\\\nYou share your information as you use and communicate through our Services, and we share your information to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customise and support our Services.\\\\n\\\\n- Send Your Information To Those With Whom You Choose To Communicate.

When you, or other users you interact with, use third-party services or other Meta Company Products that are linked through our Services, the providers of those services or products may receive the information about you that you or others share with them.

They can't hear you yet (allegedly encrypted chats) but they can see everything else: what you eat, where you shop, they browse through your trash, look into the parcels you receive, can see who visits you (their names, addresses, etc), what apps do you use, how much is on your credit card.All this can be profiled, compared to the other millions and enriched with probable other details, e.g. if 100mln others bought a bucket and a shovel, when you buy a bucket you definitely want a shovel too.
