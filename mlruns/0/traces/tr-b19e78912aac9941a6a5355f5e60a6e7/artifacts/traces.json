While Meta provides numerous privacy controls, the sheer volume and interconnectedness of data collection make it challenging for users to fully grasp and manage their privacy. Users should be extremely careful, proactively and regularly configure their privacy settings on every Meta platform they use, and consider the implications of sharing such a broad range of personal data with a single company.\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"sources_used\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy?lang=en&utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\\\",\\n      \\\"policy_type\\\": \\\"privacy_policy\\\",\\n      \\\"relevance\\\": 0.98,\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Privacy Policy\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/\\\",\\n      \\\"policy_type\\\": \\\"privacy_policy\\\",\\n      \\\"relevance\\\": 0.97,\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Meta Privacy Policy - How Meta Collects and Uses User Data\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.meta.com/legal/privacy-policy/?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\\\",\\n      \\\"policy_type\\\": \\\"privacy_policy\\\",\\n      \\\"relevance\\\": 0.96,\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Supplemental Meta Platforms Technologies Privacy Policy | Meta | Meta Store\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.facebook.com/terms/\\\",\\n      \\\"policy_type\\\": \\\"terms_of_service\\\",\\n      \\\"relevance\\\": 0.95,\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Meta Terms of Service\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.meta.com/legal/supplemental-terms-of-service/?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\\\",\\n      \\\"policy_type\\\": \\\"terms_of_service\\\",\\n      \\\"relevance\\\": 0.94,\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Supplemental Meta Platforms Technologies Terms Of Service | Meta Quest | Meta Store\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://about.instagram.com/data-policy?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\\\",\\n      \\\"policy_type\\\": \\\"data_protection\\\",\\n      \\\"relevance\\\": 0.93,\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"About Instagram's Data Policy\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.meta.com/legal/portal/data-policy/?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\\\",\\n      \\\"policy_type\\\": \\\"data_protection\\\",\\n      \\\"relevance\\\": 0.92,\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Supplemental Portal Data Policy | Meta Portal | Meta Store\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://opensource.fb.com/legal/privacy/?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\\\",\\n      \\\"policy_type\\\": \\\"privacy_policy\\\",\\n      \\\"relevance\\\": 0.88,\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Privacy Policy | Meta Open Source\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/05/metas-updated-privacy-policy/?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\\\",\\n      \\\"policy_type\\\": \\\"other\\\",\\n      \\\"relevance\\\": 0.85,\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Here's What You Need to Know About Our Updated Privacy Policy and Terms of Service\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"error_message\\\": null\\n}\"}]", "mlflow.chat.tokenUsage": "{\"input_tokens\": 9258, \"output_tokens\": 7583, \"total_tokens\": 16841}"}}]}
