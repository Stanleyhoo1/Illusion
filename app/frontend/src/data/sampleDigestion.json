For consumer products, users have significant control over whether their chat and coding session data is used for model training, with an opt-in model. Data not used for training is retained for 30 days, while opted-in data can be kept for up to 5 years. Anthropic emphasizes that personal data is incidentally included in training but not actively sought for profiling or sale, and employs safeguards like de-linking user IDs and filtering sensitive information. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest, and employee access is strictly limited. For commercial products (like Claude for Work or API), Anthropic acts as a data processor, meaning customers (controllers) dictate data usage, and data is generally not used for model training unless explicitly opted into a partner program. The company uses necessary, analytics, and marketing cookies, with user controls available for the latter two. Anthropic explicitly states it does not sell user data to third parties.",

However, the incidental inclusion of personal data in training data and the collection of screenshots for certain commercial beta features (though with specific retention policies) warrant a moderate risk rating."

        "**Delete Conversations**: You can delete conversations from your chat history, which will also remove them from backend storage within 30 days.",
        "**Control Cookies**: Exercise your 'Privacy Choices' on anthropic.com or claude.ai to manage your analytics and marketing cookie preferences. Consider enabling global privacy controls in your browser.",

Ensure your internal policies align with Anthropic's practices and your chosen settings, especially regarding the Development Partner Program."

While Anthropic offers significant user controls, particularly the opt-in for model training and clear policies against selling data, the broad collection of data for training (if opted-in) and the use of marketing cookies warrant attention. Users should actively manage their privacy settings, especially regarding data usage for model improvement and cookie preferences, to align with their comfort level. For commercial users, the control largely rests with the customer, making it crucial to understand the 'Controller' and 'Processor' roles."
